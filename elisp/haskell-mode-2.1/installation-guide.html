<h1>Haskell Mode for Emacs: Installation Guide</h1>

<p>When Emacs is started up, it normally runs a file
  called <code>~/.emacs</code> located in your home directory.  This file
  should contain all of your personal customisations written as a series of
  Elisp commands.  In order to install the Haskell mode, you have to tell
  Emacs where to find it.  This is done by adding some commands to the init
  file.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you are using XEmacs, the haskell-mode package should be
      available for installation through the XEmacs package UI.

  <li>If you are using Debian, you can install the package haskell-mode with
    a command like "apt-get install haskell-mode".
</ul>

<p>Otherwise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download and unpack the basic mode and modules into a suitable
    directory, e.g. <code>~/lib/emacs</code> where <code>~</code> stands for
    your home directory.

  <li><p>Assuming you have placed the basic
      mode <code>haskell-mode.el</code> and the modules you want to use in
      the directory <code>~/lib/emacs</code>, add the following command to
      your init file (<code>~/.emacs</code>):</p>

    <pre>(load "~/lib/emacs/haskell-site-file")</pre>

    <p>adding the following lines according to which modules you want to
      use:</p>

<pre>
(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-doc-mode)
(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-indent)
(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-simple-indent)
</pre>

    <p>Note that the two indentation modules are mutually exclusive - add at
      most one.  <!-- You can download the above <a HREF=".emacs">code</a>. -->
      Note that the line of code for simple indentation is commented out
      (using a preceeding <code>;</code>) in preference for the more
      advanced indentation module.  Installation is now complete!</p>

    <p>The other modules are automatically loaded when needed in the
      following way:
      <ul>
	<li>Font locking: just turn it on
	  via <code>global-font-lock-mode</code> or do
	  <pre>(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'font-lock-mode)</pre>
	<li>Declaration scanning: just use <code>M-x imenu</code> or
	  bind <code>imenu</code> to a key.  E.g.
	  <pre>(global-set-key [(control meta down-mouse-3)] 'imenu)</pre>
	  or you can also add it to the menubar with
	  <pre>(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'imenu-add-menubar-index)</pre>
	<li>Interaction with inferior Haskell interpreter:
	  just hit <code>C-c C-z</code> or <code>C-c C-l</code>.
      </ul>

</ul>

<p>For those interested, each command above shall now be explained.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>We must ensure that the directory
      containing <code>haskell-mode.el</code> is on
      the <code>load-path</code> of Emacs.  You can examine the value of
      the <code>load-path</code> by typing <code>C-h v load-path</code> in
      an Emacs session.  Supposing that you've
      placed <code>haskell-mode.el</code> in the
      directory <code>~/lib/emacs</code>, if this directory is not on
      the <code>load-path</code> we add it with:</p>

    <pre>(setq load-path (cons "~/lib/emacs" load-path))</pre>

    <p>The function <code>setq</code> sets the value of a variable, and the
      function <code>cons</code> takes an element and a list and creates
      a new list with the former as head and the latter as tail, as in
      Haskell.</p>

  <li><p>It is possible (and desirable) for Emacs to enter a specific mode
      according to the name of the file being edited/visited.
      The variable <code>auto-mode-alist</code> tells Emacs what mode to run
      according to which regular expression matches the filename.  We wish
      to run the Haskell mode on all files ending
      in <code>.hs</code>, <code>.hi</code> (interface file)
      and <code>.gs</code> (Gofer file), and to run the Haskell mode for
      literate scripts on all files ending in <code>.lhs</code>
      and <code>.lgs</code>.  To do this, we need to add pairs of the
      form <code>(<em>regexp</em> . <em>mode-function</em>)</code>.  We use
      the function <code>append</code> to append a list of three such pairs
      to the end of the value of <code>auto-mode-alist</code>.  A list in
      Elisp is written within round parantheses with elements separated by
      whitespace.  A list is treated as a function application unless it is
      quoted with <code>'</code>, which is what we do.</p>

  <li><p>In order for Emacs to know where to find the definition of our mode
      functions, <code>haskell-mode</code>
      and <code>literate-haskell-mode</code>, we must use the
      function <code>autoload</code>.  Both mode functions can be found in
      the file <code>haskell-mode.el</code> which was downloaded in the
      first installation step (the <code>.el</code> extension is left off
      and assumed by Emacs).  As we have already ensured that this file is
      on the <code>load-path</code> we need only give the filename and not
      the directory.  Its use is quite straightforward but for further
      information, see its documentation by entering <code>C-h
	f autoload</code> in an Emacs session.</p>

  <li><p>Each function <code>turn-on-haskell-<em>module</em></code> turns on
      the corresponding module.  Adding such a function as a hook to the
      Haskell mode will turn on that module when the mode is used.
      Note that each of these modules may slow down Emacs, especially for
      large files.</p>

</ol>

<h2>Customisation</h2>

<p>Most customisations are on the functionality of a particular module.
  See the documentation of that module for information on its
  customisation.</p>
