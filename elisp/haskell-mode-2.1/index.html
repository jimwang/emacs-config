</head><body>

<h1>Haskell Mode for Emacs</h1>

<p>The Haskell mode itself is very basic, but provides a base on which to
  build modules.  The currently supported modules are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Font Locking: Colours keywords, comments, strings, etc.

  <li>Declaration Scanning: Scans declarations and places them in a
    menu.  <em>Seems to hang on some files.</em>

  <li>Documentation: Echoes types of functions or syntax of keywords
    when the cursor is idle.  <em>Not up-to-date for Haskell-98.</em>

  <li><a HREF="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lapalme/layout/">Indentation</a>:
    Provides semi-automatic intelligent indentation.

  <li>Simple Indentation: Provides simple indentation.

  <li>Interaction with an inferior Haskell interpreter.  This module
    supersedes the previous two modules:
    <ul>
      <li><a HREF="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lapalme/Hugs-interaction.html">
	  Hugs Interaction</a>: Allows interaction with the Hugs interpreter.

      <li><a HREF="http://home.arachsys.com/~chris/haskell-ghci.el">GHCi
	  Interaction</a>: Allows interaction with the GHCi interpreter.
    </ul>
</ul>

<em>Work on further modules is encouraged!  Please
  <a HREF="mailto:monnier@iro.umontreal.ca">mail</a> if you have an idea, or
  a module we might hook into.</em>

<p><a HREF="haskell-mode-2.0.tar.gz">The latest versions of the basic mode
    and the above modules</a>.</p>

<p>The basic mode was written by Graeme E Moss, Tommy Thorn and Simon
  Marlow.  Modules with their own links above are maintained by their
  authors; the rest are looking for a maintainer (please
  volunteer!).  These modules support Haskell 98, except where stated, and
  have been tested on GNU Emacs versions 19.34 and 20.7, and XEmacs versions
  21.1.14 and 21.4.x.  Please mail bugs and suggestions to the maintainer of
  the appropriate module.  General comments can be mailed
  to <a HREF="mailto:monnier@iro.umontreal.ca">Stefan
    Monnier</a>.  When mailing, quote the version of the module or mode you
  are using, the version of Emacs you are using, and a small example of the
  problem or suggestion.  Please check the list of known problems (towards
  the start of each relevant file) before doing so.</p>

<p><strong><a HREF="installation-guide.html">A guide on how to install
and customise the mode</a></strong>.</p>

<p>To test the mode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To test font locking, declaration scanning, and documentation
    modules, try them on <a HREF="fontlock.hs">the Haskell
      script</a> used to illustrate these modules in action.

  <li>To test indentation and simple indentation modules, try them
    on <a HREF="indent.hs">this Haskell script</a>.

</ul>
