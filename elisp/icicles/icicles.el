;;
;;  Minibuffer input completion and cycling of completion candidates.
;;
;;  Input completion takes as input a string and returns a name that
;;  contains the input string.  This library enables minibuffer
;;  cycling of completion candidates, and provides additional support
;;  for input completion.
;;
;;  Two kinds of completion are offered here, which are distinguished
;;  by how the input string is matched against the completed name:
;;
;;   - Prefix completion - The input string is a prefix of the
;;                         completed name.  This is the usual Emacs
;;                         completion.
;;
;;   - Apropos completion - The input string is a regular expression
;;                          that matches somewhere (anywhere) within
;;                          the completed name.  You can think of the
;;                          name as having been returned by `apropos'
;;                          (except it also works for file and buffer
;;                          names).
;;
;;  This file contains the doc for Icicles.  You can also read this
;;  doc, in formatted form, on the Emacs-Wiki Web site:
;;  http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Icicles.  Emacs Wiki also
;;  has a few addtional pages about Icicles.  In particular, if you
;;  are new to Emacs, as well as Icicles, see this page:
;;  http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsNewbieWithIcicles.
;;
;;  See also: Library `icicles-menu.el', which lets you execute menu
;;  commands, cycling and completing them.
 
;;(@* "Installing Icicles")
;;
;;  To use this library:
;;
;;    Add this to your initialization file (~/.emacs or ~/_emacs):
;;
;;      (require 'icicles) ; Load this library.
;;      (icicle-mode 1)    ; Turn on Icicle mode.
;;
;;    It is best to add this code *after* any code that creates or
;;    changes key bindings, so Icicles can pick up all of your key
;;    definitions (bindings).  However, if you make new bindings, you
;;    can always exit and then reenter Icicle mode to pick them up.
;;
;;    You will need all of these libraries (loaded by `icicles.el'):
;;
;;      `icicles-cmd.el'
;;      `icicles-face.el'
;;      `icicles-fn.el'
;;      `icicles-mac.el'
;;      `icicles-mcmd.el'
;;      `icicles-mode.el'
;;      `icicles-opt.el'
;;      `icicles-var.el'
;;
;;    It is of course best to byte-compile all of the libraries.  You
;;    will likely get some byte-compiler warning messages.  These are
;;    probably benign - ignore them.  Icicles is designed to work with
;;    multiple versions of Emacs, and that fact provokes compiler
;;    warnings.  If you get byte-compiler errors (not warnings), then
;;    please report a bug, using `M-x icicle-send-bug-report'.
;;
;;    After startup, you can turn Icicle mode on or off at any time
;;    interactively, using command `icy-mode' (aka `icicle-mode' -
;;    prefix `icy' is unique to this command, so it is easier to
;;    complete).
;;
;;    Note: If you turn on Icicle mode in your init file, it's best to
;;    do so as late as possible - after you or any libraries that you
;;    load do any key binding.  This is because Icicles uses the
;;    current global key bindings to determine which keys to bind for
;;    minibuffer completion and cycling.  To pick up the latest
;;    bindings at any time, you can of course enter Icicle mode
;;    interactively using command `icy-mode' (if necessary, exit, then
;;    re-enter).

;;  Index
;;  -----
;;
;;  If you have library `linkd.el' and Emacs 22 or later, load
;;  `linkd.el' and turn on `linkd-mode' now.  It lets you easily
;;  navigate around the sections of this doc.  Linkd mode will
;;  highlight this Index, as well as the cross-references and section
;;  headings throughout this file.  You can get `linkd.el' here:

;;  Nutshell View of Icicles
;;  ------------------------
;;
;;  Load this library, turn on Icicle mode, and you're good to go.
;;  You can turn Icicle mode off or on at any time with command
;;  `icy-mode'.
;;
;;  Beyond that, the most important thing to know about Icicles is
;;  that you can get help on Icicle mode and minibuffer completion
;;  whenever completion is possible.  You do that either by using the
;;  menu-bar Icicles menu, item Help or by hitting `C-?'.
;;
;;  You now know enough to use Icicles.  If you have doc-phobia or are
;;  easily overwhelmed by explanations, then *read no more* - just try
;;  it!
;;
;;  If you want a little more explanation than the help page (`C-?'),
;;  then read this page ("Nutshell View of Icicles"), but no more.
;;  This page shows a sample of what you can do in Icicle mode.
;;
;;(@* "Cycle Completion Candidates")
;;  ** Cycle Completion Candidates **
;;
;;   M-x  t o o l  next
;;
;;  That is, type "tool" and then hit the `next' key, which is often
;;  labeled "Page Down".  Each time you hit `next', another match for
;;  your input (`tool') replaces it in the minibuffer.
;;
;;   M-x ediff-toggle-use-toolbar  next
;;   M-x scroll-bar-toolkit-scroll next
;;   M-x tool-bar-mode             next
;;   M-x tooltip-mode              next
;;   M-x ediff-toggle-use-toolbar ; Back to the beginning
;;
;;  Keys `next' and `prior' ("Page Up") cycle among all of the
;;  commands that contain (match) the minibuffer input - `tool', in
;;  this case.  Just hit `RET' (Return) when you get to the command
;;  you want.
;;
;;  You can use a regular expression, to narrow the field of matching
;;  inputs:
;;
;;   M-x  i s e . + c h a r   next
;;   M-x isearch-*-char       next
;;   M-x isearch-delete-char  next
;;   ...
;;
;;  See (@> "Cycling Completions"), below, for more about cycling
;;  completion candidates.
;;
;;(@* "Display Completion Candidates")
;;  ** Display Completion Candidates **
;;
;;  You can display all of the matches for the current minibuffer
;;  input, in the *Completions* buffer, with `S-TAB' (Shift TAB).  So,
;;  for instance, `S-TAB' with `M-x ise.+char' in the minibuffer
;;  displays all commands whose names contain `ise' followed
;;  (somewhere) by `char'.
;;
;;(@* "Prefix Completion and Apropos Completion")
;;  ** Prefix Completion and Apropos Completion **
;;
;;  You can get the standard Emacs "prefix" completion, instead of
;;  this "apropos completion", by using `TAB' instead of `S-TAB'.  You
;;  can cycle prefix-completion candidates by using the `up' and
;;  `down' arrow keys instead of `next' and `prior'.
;;
;;  See (@> "Apropos Completions"), below, for more about apropos
;;  and prefix completion.
;;
;;(@* "Chains of Simple Match Patterns - Progressive Completion")
;;  ** Chains of Simple Match Patterns - Progressive Completion **
;;
;;  To see which functions contain `char', `delete', and `back' in
;;  their names, in any order:
;;
;;   C-h f  c h a r  S-TAB - display all function names that contain
;;   `char'.
;;
;;   M-*  d e l e t e  - narrow that set of names to those that also
;;   contain `delete'.
;;
;;   M-*  b a c k  - narrow the set of matching names further, to
;;   those that also contain `back'.
;;
;;  This displays a list of functions like this in buffer
;;  *Completions* (your list might be somewhat different):
;;
;;    `backward-delete-char' `backward-delete-char-untabify'
;;    `delete-backward-char' `icicle-backward-delete-char-untabify'
;;    `icicle-delete-backward-char'
;;    `quail-conversion-backward-delete-char'
;;
;;  Since you are completing input to `C-h f', you can then cycle to a
;;  name using `next' and hit `RET', or click `mouse-2', to see the
;;  doc for that function.  If, instead, you were completing input to
;;  `M-x', you could choose a command to execute.  And so on.
;;
;;  The thing to notice here is that you can use `M-*' to input chains
;;  of multiple simple regexps, to narrow down the set of completion
;;  candidates progressively.  This is analogous to piping the result
;;  of `grep' to another `grep', and piping that result to another
;;  `grep'...
;;
;;  Here are a couple others to try (I'm always forgetting the order
;;  in these compound names):
;;
;;   C-h f  w i n d o w  S-TAB M-*  f r a m e
;;
;;   C-h f  w i n d o w  S-TAB M-*  b u f f e r
;;
;;  See (@> "Progressive Completion"), below, for more about progressive
;;  completion with `M-*'.
;;
;;(@* "Chipping Away the Non-Elephant")
;;  ** Chipping Away the Non-Elephant **
;;
;;  There's a joke about a sculptor who, when asked how he created
;;  such a life-like statue of an elephant, said that he just chipped
;;  steadily away, removing marble that didn't resemble an elephant.
;;
;;  Icicles lets you sculpt this way too - it is in fact a common
;;  Icicles usage idiom.  There are two ways to say, "I don't want
;;  that" when it comes to possible completions:
;;
;;  * The `delete' key or `S-mouse-2' says, "Get rid of this
;;    completion candidate."
;;
;;  * `C-~' says "I want all possible completions *except* those that
;;    are the current matches.  That is, "Remove all of this, and let
;;    me see what's left."  `C-~' takes the complement of the current
;;    set of matches, using the initial set of possible candidates as
;;    the universe of discourse.
;;
;;  In other words, instead of coming up with input that you want a
;;  completion to match, get rid of one or all of the candidates that
;;  do match.  You can keep clicking `mouse-2' while holding Shift, or
;;  keep hitting `delete' (without Shift), to chip away at the set of
;;  possible completions.  If there are several candidates in a row
;;  that you want to eliminate, just hold down the `delete' key until
;;  they're gone.
;;
;;  So that you can use `delete' this way to delete candidates one
;;  after the other, in order, the next candidate is chosen each time
;;  you delete one.  This means that it becomes the current candidate
;;  in the minibuffer.  You can, however, use `C-l' (bound to command
;;  `icicle-retrieve-last-input') to clear the minibuffer and retrieve
;;  your last real input.
;;
;;  `delete' works well to delete isolated candidates or groups of
;;  candidates that are in order, one right after the other, and you
;;  can of course combine it with positive matching.
;;
;;  Note: In Emacs releases prior to Emacs 22, `delete' has no real
;;  effect on file-name completion candidates.  It removes them
;;  temporarily, but they are not really removed as possible
;;  candidates, so `TAB' and `S-TAB' will still show them as
;;  candidates.
;;
;;  `C-~' is particularly handy in combination with progressive
;;  completion (`M-*') to narrow down a set of candidates, especially
;;  when you are not exactly sure what you are looking for.  You can
;;  repeat `C-~' with different inputs to eliminate everything matched
;;  by each of them.  In other words, this is a variable-size chisel,
;;  and you can use it to remove very large chips.
;;
;;  For instance, suppose you are looking for a standard Emacs command
;;  involving buffers.  You try `M-x buff S-TAB', but that shows
;;  zillions of matches.  Suppose that you know you don't want a
;;  command in some 3rd-party package.  You proceed to eliminate
;;  those, progressively, using something like this:
;;
;;    M-* ediff C-~ ibuffer C-~ icicle C-~ Buffer-menu C-~ ps- C-~
;;        ido C-~ search-buffers C-~ moccur C-~ swbuff C-~
;;
;;  And so on.  That is, instead of using `M-*' repeatedly to specify
;;  multiple patterns that candidates must match, you use `C-~'
;;  repeatedly (after an initial `M-*'), to chip away candidates you
;;  don't want.  You could, alternatively, hold down the `delete' key
;;  to eliminate each of these groups of command names.  There are
;;  over 100 commands whose names begin with `ediff', however, so `M-*
;;  C-~' can be quicker in that case.  It can definitely be quicker
;;  when apropos matching is involved.  And you can of course combine
;;  the fine chiseling of `delete' with the variable-size chiseling of
;;  `C-~'.
;;
;;  See (@> "Sets of Completion Candidates", below, for more about
;;  `C-~'.

;;(@* "Help on Completion Candidates")
;;  ** Help on Completion Candidates **
;;
;;  Sometimes, you'd like to be able to ask for help about individual
;;  completion candidates, while you're in the process of choosing
;;  one.  That's the purpose of the Icicles `C-M-' key bindings
;;  available during completion.

;;  The simplest such bindings are `C-M-RET' and `C-M-mouse2'.  They
;;  each do the same thing: provide help on the current candidate.
;;  You can use them during cycling, or whenever you've narrowed the
;;  choice down to a single candidate.  You can check this way, before
;;  you execute a command you're unsure of.

;;  During completion, you can also cycle among the doc strings for
;;  the candidates that match your input, using `C-M-down' and
;;  `C-M-up' (for prefix matching), `C-M-next' and `C-M-prior' (for
;;  apropos matching).  This gives you a very useful on-the-fly
;;  apropos feature - use it while you're completing a command, to
;;  check the difference between several possible commands.  Or just
;;  use it to browse doc strings, to learn more about Emacs.

;;

;;
;;  Nothing new here.  Now try the same thing, but use `C-RET' instead

;;
;;  You just opened three files in a single command.  Command
;;  `icicle-find-file' (`C-x C-f') is an Icicles multi-command.  You
;;  can tell if a command is a multi-command when you execute it - if
;;  so, the input prompt is prefixed by `+'.  So, for example, when
;;  you used `C-x C-f', the prompt was "+ File or directory:".
;;  Icicles menu items that are multi-commands are also prefixed by
;;  `+'.
;;
;;  In addition to using `down' (or `next') and choosing candidates
;;  with `C-RET', you can combine these operations by using `C-down'
;;  (or `C-next'): choose candidates in succession.  You can also use
;;  `C-!'  to choose all candidates at once.
;;
;;  There are lots of Icicles multi-commands; `icicle-search' (`C-`')
;;  is another.  In this case, the completion candidates are the
;;  buffer occurrences that match a regexp that you input.  `C-RET'
;;  visits a search-hit candidate, and `C-next' visits a candidate and
;;  prepares to visit the next in succession.  Do this in buffer
;;  `icicles.el':
;;
;;    C-`
;;    Search for (regexp): . * r e c u r s i v e . *  RET - Search for
;;    regexp `.*recursive.*'.
;;
;;    Choose an occurrence: S-TAB - Show the search hits, in buffer
;;    *Completions* (optional).
;;
;;    C-next ... - Cycle among the search hits, navigating to them in
;;    turn.
;;
;;    S-TAB next ... - Cycle among the search hits without navigating.
;;
;;    next ... C-RET next ... C-RET - Cycle to particular hits and

;;
;;    next ... RET - Cycle to a hit and stay there (end).
;;

;;    C-`
;;    Search for (regexp): M-p RET - Search again for `.*recursive.*'
;;    (input history).
;;
;;    S-TAB  e d i t  C-next ... - Search for substring `edit' within
;;    all search hits for `.*recursive.*'.  Cycle among the matches.
;;    The longest common substring is`abort-recursive-edit', so that
;;    is highlighted inside the (differently) highlighted
;;    `.*recursive.*' hits.  Whatever you type filters the initial set
;;    of hits.
;;
;;    M-k - Empty the minibuffer.  All `.*recursive.*' hits are restored
;;    as candidates.  Again, whatever your input is (nothing, now),
;;    the set of candidates is dynamically updated to match it.
;;
;;    l e v  S-TAB C-next ... - Search for substring `lev' within all
;;    search hits for `.*recursive.*'.  The longest common substring,
;;    `level', is highlighted inside each candidate.
;;
;;    RET - Stop searching at the current candidate (end).
;;
;;  Now try the same thing, but first select some text.  The search is
;;  confined to the active region (selection) instead of the entire
;;  buffer.
;;
;;  Now try the same thing (without a region), but use a prefix
;;  argument (`C-u') with `C-`'.  This time, after you input the
;;  regexp to search for, you are prompted for one or more buffers to
;;  search.  This too is multi-command input: you can input any number
;;  of buffer names, using completion.
;;
;;    C-u C-`
;;    Search for (regexp): . * r e c u r s i v e . *  RET - Search for
;;    regexp `.*recursive.*'.
;;
;;    Choose buffer (`RET' when done):  i c i  TAB - Choose among
;;    candidates that begin with `ici' (shown in *Completions*).
;;
;;    C-! - Choose all matching buffers: icicles-cmd.el,
;;    icicles-opt.el, icicles.el.
;;
;;    Choose an occurrence: S-TAB - Show the hits in buffer
;;    *Completions* (optional).
;;
;;    C-next ... - Cycle among the search hits in all chosen
;;    buffers...
;;
;;  Just as you can choose particular search hits to visit, using
;;  `C-RET', so you can use `C-RET' to choose particular buffers
;;  (whose names match the input, e.g. ici) to search.  Just as you
;;  can visit search hits in order, using `C-next' (or `C-down'), so
;;  you can use `C-next' (or `C-down') to choose buffers to visit, one
;;  after the other.
;;
;;  There are many possible uses of multi-commands.  They all make use

;;  ** Complete Keys Too **
;;
;;  Try `S-TAB' at the top level (without first invoking a command
;;  that reads input).  Icicles presents all of the possible keys and
;;  their bindings in the current context - for completion.  For
;;  example, if you are in Dired mode, the completion candidates
;;  include all key sequences in the global map and the Dired-mode map
;;  (and any current minor-mode maps, such as Icicle mode).
;;
;;  You can then type part of a key name or a command name, and hit
;;  `S-TAB' again to apropos-complete your input.  You can navigate
;;  down the key-sequence hierarchy by completing a key sequence piece
;;  by piece:
;;
;;    S-TAB to see the available keys at top level
;;
;;    Click (using `mouse-2') candidate `C-x = ...', to see the keys
;;    that start with `C-x'
;;
;;    Click `r = ...', to see the keys that start with `C-x r'
;;
;;    Click `b = bookmark-jump', to invoke that command and visit a
;;    bookmark
;;
;;  Whenever you're completing a prefix key, such as `C-x', you can
;;  click `..' to navigate back up the key-sequence hierarchy.  For
;;  instance, if you are completing `C-x p', click `..' to go back to
;;  completing `C-x', and then click `..' to go back to the top level.
;;
;;  The available keys at any level include the following important
;;  keys, which means that you can use Icicles key completion to do
;;  almost anything in Emacs:
;;
;;  * `M-x' - Execute an arbitrary command (`M-x' is treated as
;;    `ESC-x', so complete first `ESC = ...', then
;;    `x = icicle-execute-extended-command')
;;
;;  * `M-:' - Evaluate any Emacs-Lisp expression (again, this is
;;    treated as `ESC-:', so complete first `ESC = ...', then
;;    `: = eval-expression')
;;
;;  * `menu-bar = ...' - Invoke any menu-bar menu (continue
;;    completing, to navigate the entire menu hierarchy)
;;
;;  You can start directly with a key prefix, and then hit `S-TAB' to
;;  complete it - you need not start with `S-TAB'.  You can use
;;  Icicles key completion to learn key bindings - `C-M-mouse-2'
;;  displays help on any key.
;;
;;  Instead of clicking a completion candidate with `mouse-2', you can
;;  of course type part of the key name or command name, and then
;;  complete the name and enter it.  Gotcha: `S-TAB' uses apropos
;;  completion, by default, so remember that typing `.' matches any
;;  character (except a newline).  To match only `..', either use
;;  prefix completion (`TAB') or escape the regexp special character:
;;  `\.\.' (or use `^\.').

;;
;;  Inserting Text Found Near the Cursor
;;  ------------------------------------
;;
;;  Most of Icicles is about completing text that you type in the
;;  minibuffer against some set of possible completion candidates.
;;  This feature is not.  It is related only in the sense that it is
;;  also about inputting text that is already available elsewhere.
;;
;;  Some Emacs commands provide, as the default value for minibuffer
;;  input, a word or other text at the cursor position (aka "point").
;;  You can insert this default value in the minibuffer with `M-n'.
;;  Icicles option `icicle-init-value-flag' can be used to
;;  automatically insert the default value into the minibuffer as an
;;  initial value, if you prefer that behavior (I do; many people do
;;  not).
;;
;;  Sometimes you would like to use the text at the cursor, but the
;;  command asking for input does not let you retrieve that text as
;;  the default value.  For example, if the text at point is a file
;;  name, you might like to use it with `C-x f' to open that file.
;;  Or, if the text is a URL, you might want to visit it using a Web
;;  browser.
;;
;;  Some Emacs-Lisp libraries, such as `ffap.el', have as their
;;  specific purpose to help you do this.  "Ffap" stands for
;;  `find-file-at-point', the main command in that library.  It tries
;;  to interpret the text at point and "do the right thing" with it:
;;  visit a file, open a URL in a Web browser, and so on.
;;
;;  If you like, you can use library `ffap.el' with Icicles.  All
;;  Icicles features are then available during file-name and URL
;;  completion.  And if you like `ffap.el', you might also like to try
;;  my extension library `ffap-.el'.  However, if you use ffap with
;;  Icicles, you might not want to use the ffap key bindings,
;;  preferring the Icicles bindings or the standard Emacs bindings for
;;  keys such as `C-x C-f'.  (In that case, do not call function
;;  `ffap-bindings'.)
;;
;;  Icicles provides a simple way to take advantage of `ffap-guesser',
;;  the ffap function that guesses which string at the cursor position
;;  you want to grab, without sacrificing any key bindings to ffap.
;;  Just use `M-.' (command `icicle-insert-string-at-point') at any
;;  time in the minibuffer.  It grabs text at or near the cursor and
;;  yanks it into the minibuffer.  By default, the text it grabs is
;;  whatever `ffap-guesser' guesses.
;;
;;  Using `M-.' on demand, instead of binding keys to ffap commands,
;;  lets you control which buffer text you use as minibuffer input and
;;  how that text should be interpreted (file name, URL, and so on).
;;  By default, `M-.' uses `ffap-guesser', but you can change this by
;;  customizing user option `icicle-thing-at-point-functions'.
;;
;;  Actually, `M-.' acts differently if you use it successively.
;;  Successive uses of `M-.' grab and insert either 1) alternative
;;  bits of text (different text "things") or 2) successive bits of
;;  text.  The default behavior is #1, but you can change this choice
;;  by customizing option `icicle-default-thing-insertion' (setting it
;;  to `more-of-the-same', instead of `alternatives').
;;
;;  As an example of grabbing successive bits of text (#2), suppose
;;  that the cursor is at the beginning of the word "use" in the
;;  previous paragraph.  Then, during minibuffer input, suppose that
;;  you use `M-. M-. M-.'.  Each time you hit `M-.', another word is
;;  inserted in the minibuffer:
;;
;;    use
;;    use it
;;    use it successively
;;    ...
;;
;;  The rest of this section is a bit technical, so you might want to
;;  skip it if you are reading the Icicles doc for the first time.  It
;;  details the behavior and definitions of options
;;  `icicle-default-thing-insertion' and
;;  `icicle-thing-at-point-functions', and how to temporarily override
;;  those settings interactively.
;;
;;  Option `icicle-thing-at-point-functions' controls which text at or
;;  near the cursor `M-.' inserts into the minibuffer.  It is a cons
;;  cell, that is, an ordered pair:
;;
;;  * The car (first part) is a list of functions that grab different
;;    kinds of strings at or near point (#1, above).  Any number of
;;    functions can be used.  They are used in sequence by `M-.'.  By
;;    default, there are four functions, which alternatively grab:
;;
;;    1) whatever `ffap-guesser' returns (e.g. file name at point)
;;    2) the symbol or file name at point
;;    3) the word at point
;;    4) the URL at point
;;
;;  * The cdr (second part) is a function that advances point one text
;;    thing (#2, above).  Each time command `M-.' is used
;;    successively, this is called to grab more things of text (of the
;;    same kind).  The default function grabs successive words.
;;
;;  If either the car or cdr is empty, then the other alone determines
;;  the behavior of `M-.'.  Otherwise, option
;;  `icicle-default-thing-insertion' determines whether the car or the
;;  cdr is used by `M-.'.
;;
;;  For example, if the value of `icicle-default-thing-insertion' is
;;  `alternatives' (the default value), then repeated use of `M-.'
;;  inserts a different kind of thing at point: ffap guess, file name,
;;  word, or URL.  If you set `icicle-default-thing-insertion' to
;;  `more-of-the-same', then repeated use of `M-.' inserts successive
;;  words into the minibuffer, as shown in the example above.
;;
;;  You need not make a final choice once and for all between
;;  `alternatives' and `more-of-the-same'.  You can also make an
;;  interactive choice by using a prefix argument (`C-u') at any time
;;  to override the value of `icicle-default-thing-insertion'.  If you
;;  use plain `C-u', then `M-.' inserts alternative strings.  If you
;;  use a numeric prefix argument N (not just plain `C-u'), then it is
;;  the same as using `M-.' N times with `more-of-the-same' as the
;;  value of `icicle-default-thing-insertion'.
;;
;;  And, if the numeric argument is negative, then text is grabbed to
;;  the left of the cursor, instead of to the right.  In the example
;;  above, if you used `M-- M-. M-. M-.', then the successive
;;  insertions would be as follows:
;;
;;  differently
;;  differently if
;;  differently if you
;;  ...
;;
;;  If you used `M--3 M-.', then you would immediately insert
;;  `differently if you'.
;;
;;  In the case of `alternatives', there are four possibilities, by
;;  default.  The first function in the list is `ffap-guesser'.  The
;;  second function grabs text that has the syntax of an Emacs-Lisp
;;  symbol name, which in practice can also be a file name or a URL -
;;  it can include characters such as -, /, +, ., :, @, and _.  The
;;  third function grabs a word, which includes letters, ' and -.  The
;;  fourth function grabs a URL, adding prefix "http://" if needed.
;;  These are the functions used by default, but you can add to them
;;  or replace them.
;;
;;  If you use my library `thingatpt+.el', then the cursor need not be
;;  exactly on the text for the second and third alternatives - the
;;  symbol or word *nearest* the cursor is grabbed.

;;
;;  Background on Vanilla Emacs Input Completion
;;  --------------------------------------------
;;
;;  This section reviews standard Emacs behavior regarding input
;;  completion.  It does not describe any Icicles completion features.
;;
;;  When you are prompted in the minibuffer to enter something, you
;;  are sometimes presented with a default value.  This might be
;;  automatically inserted after the prompt, initially.  If not, you
;;  can retrieve the default value yourself, using `M-n' (Emacs 21 or
;;  later).
;;
;;  Often, there is more than one reasonable default value that might
;;  make sense.  Depending on what you're being asked to enter, these
;;  "candidate default values" might be command names, buffer names,
;;  existing file names, variable names, and so on.
;;
;;  For most Emacs functions that prompt you for input, the person who
;;  wrote the function decided on the reasonable set of default
;;  values, and passed these to an "input-completing function" such as
;;  `completing-read' or `read-file-name', which prompts you and reads
;;  your input.  The programmer also decided whether you will be
;;  *required* to pick one of the default values or you will be free
;;  to enter something else.  The programmer might also have told the
;;  input-completing function to require that your input pass some
;;  special test (predicate).
;;
;;  Be aware that standard Emacs terminology does not refer to such a
;;  set of default values as "default values"; they are called
;;  "completions".  By "default value", standard Emacs terminology
;;  means only the single value that you can access via `M-n'.
;;  Icicles refers to all such potential inputs indifferently as
;;  "default values", "completions", "completion candidates", and
;;  "candidates".  Whenever completion is not requiring you to pick
;;  one of the available candidates, they are effectively only default
;;  choices.
;;
;;  So, how do you get access to the default values that the
;;  programmer has made available to you, in order to choose one?  You
;;  hit certain keys to complete the current contents of the
;;  minibuffer (excluding the prompt).  This current, partial input is
;;  considered as a prefix of one of the default values, and it is
;;  completed in the minibuffer to the entire default value
;;  (completion).
;;
;;  Keys `TAB', `RET' (Return), and `SPC' (Space) perform different
;;  degrees of this "prefix completion" in standard Emacs.  If you
;;  type a prefix of one of the available default values, you can
;;  complete the value this way in the minibuffer, and then enter
;;  (commit) it, using `RET'.
;;
;;  But if your partial input matches the prefix of more than one
;;  default value, then completion pops up the list of all matching
;;  completions for you to choose from (in buffer *Completions*).  You
;;  choose a candidate by clicking it with `mouse-2' or placing the
;;  cursor on it and hitting `RET'.
;;
;;  Because this is the way you access the default values supplied to
;;  an input-completing function, I call those values
;;  "prefix-completion candidates".  If there is no partial input yet
;;  (empty minibuffer), then the entire list of default values
;;  supplied to the input-completing function appears in the pop-up
;;  *Completions* buffer.  See the Emacs manual (`C-h i') for more on
;;  this general mechanism of prefix completion (called simply
;;  "completion" there).
;;
;;  Calls to `completing-read' and `read-file-name' are not the only
;;  places where input completion is used.  When you use `M-x'
;;  (command `execute-extended-command'), completion is also
;;  available.
 
;;(@* "Cycling Completions")
;;
;;  Cycling Completions
;;  -------------------
;;
;;  Icicles lets you use the `up' and `down' arrow keys or `C-p' and
;;  `C-n' to cycle through the list of candidate prefix completions
;;  that match whatever input is present in the minibuffer (or all
;;  candidate completions, if there is no input in the minibuffer).
;;  In the minibuffer, each candidate replaces your partial input, in
;;  turn, when you cycle.  The prefix (root) that was completed is
;;  underlined in the minibuffer completion candidate.
;;
;;  Suppose you use `C-x b' (command `switch-to-buffer').  You can
;;  then use `C-n' until the right buffer name appears in the
;;  minibuffer, then hit `RET'.  Or you can type some text that begins
;;  one or more of the buffer names, and then use `C-n' to cycle among
;;  those names that match that prefix.  If there are many candidates,
;;  typing part of the name to narrow the field can save time.
;;
;;  Another example: Suppose you use `C-h v' (`describe-variable') and
;;  type `cal'.  Use `C-n' to cycle among all variables that start
;;  with `cal', until you find the one you want (then hit `RET').
;;
;;  In other words, the current partial input in the minibuffer
;;  determines a matching set of default values, and those are the
;;  values that you can cycle through.  You can at any time erase or
;;  change the partial input - the list of matching candidates
;;  automatically reflects the change.
;;
;;  This also means that it's good to have a quick way to clear the
;;  minibuffer of any input, so Icicles also provides minibuffer key
;;  binding `M-k' to do that.
;;
;;  A visible and audible signal lets you know when you have reached
;;  one end of the list of completion candidates, but you can of
;;  course continue to cycle, wrapping around.
;;
;;  If the completion candidates are already displayed in buffer
;;  *Completions* when you try to cycle among them (because you hit
;;  `TAB'), then the current candidate is highlighted in *Completions*
;;  as you access it in the minibuffer with the `up' and `down' arrow
;;  keys.  If you change the minibuffer input, then the *Completions*
;;  list is updated accordingly, to reflect the new set of matching
;;  candidates.  The root that was completed (the minibuffer input) is
;;  highlighted in each candidate of the *Completions* display.  The
;;  *Completions* window is automatically scrolled as needed, to show
;;  the current candidate.
;;
;;  Don't become a cycling drone!  Input some text to narrow the set
;;  of candidates, before cycling among them to choose one.  This is a
;;  good habit to adopt, generally, in Icicles.  Most of the power of
;;  Icicles comes in your ability to filter a set of candidates.  This
;;  is especially true when it comes to regexp filtering (see
;;  (@> "Apropos Completions"), below).
;;
;;  Cycling and filtering work hand in hand.  If the set of candidates
;;  is small to begin with, then just cycling might be quick enough -
;;  that is the case if you move among a small set of buffers, for
;;  instance.  But with Icicles you can profitably use cycling on even
;;  a very large set of candidates - by filtering the set first.  The
;;  reason this is not very practical with vanilla Emacs is that
;;  filtering by a prefix only is not very potent.
;;
;;  Tip: Whenever you type or delete text in the minibuffer, your
;;  partial input is remembered.  When you cycle completion
;;  candidates, your input is replaced by each candidate, but you can
;;  at any time refresh the minibuffer to retrieve what you last
;;  typed.  You do this with `C-l', which is bound in the minibuffer
;;  to command `icicle-retrieve-last-input'.  Editing a completion
;;  candidate that you have cycled into the minibuffer counts as
;;  input.  Editing tells Icicles to remember what is in the
;;  minibuffer as your last real input.  If you want to replace the
;;  candidate and go back to editing the input you had already typed
;;  before cycling, then use `C-l' - don't just delete characters from
;;  the candidate.
;;
;;  You can change the keys that are bound to completion-candidate
;;  cycling (`up', `down', `C-p', and `C-n') - see 
;;  (@> "Customizing Key Bindings"), below.
;;
;;  If you are an Emacs-Lisp programmer, then you can use
;;  `completing-read' and `read-file-name' to define your own
;;  commands, enabling them to take advantage of Icicles completion
;;  and cycling.  The definition of command `icicle-recent-file' is a
;;  good model to follow.  Emacs has a `recentf-mode' that lets you
;;  open recently accessed files.  But this mode makes you open a file
;;  using a menu interface.  Command `icicle-recent-file' lets you use
;;  the usual `find-file' minibuffer interface, with completion and
;;  cycling among your recent files.  See sections 
;;  (@> "Defining Icicles Commands") and (@> "Note to Programmers"), below,
;;  for more on defining your own commands with `completing-read' and
;; `read-file-name'.
 
;;(@* "Traversing Minibuffer Histories")
;;
;;  Traversing Minibuffer Histories
;;  -------------------------------
;;
;;  Perhaps you are already used to accessing past inputs using the
;;  `down' and `up' arrow keys, `C-n' and `C-p', `M-n' and `M-p', or
;;  `next' and `prior'.  If not, try it.  You can go backward and
;;  forward in the minibuffer histories (there are different history
;;  lists for different kinds of input).  You can't really cycle them
;;  (with wraparound), but when you get to one end you can reverse the
;;  direction.
;;
;;  Anyway, the input-cycling behavior that Icicles offers is in
;;  addition to this standard traversal of histories.  Since there
;;  are, by default, several extra pairs of keys used for history
;;  traversal, rebinding some of them to use for Icicles completion is
;;  no real loss.
;;
;;  By default, Icicles rebinds all of the key sequences that you
;;  normally use for commands `next-line' and `previous-line', so that
;;  they perform prefix-completion cycling in the minibuffer.  In
;;  vanilla Emacs, this means keys `down', `up', `C-n', and `C-p'.
;;
;;  Icicles also rebinds `next' and `prior' for apropos-completion
;;  cycling (see below).  You still have `M-n' and `M-p' available to
;;  access past inputs (history).  And the rebindings are only for
;;  minibuffer input; global bindings are not affected.
;;
;;  You can at any time switch back and forth between input-history
;;  traversal (`M-n', `M-p') and prefix completion (`C-n', `C-p' or
;;  `down', `up').
;;
;;  See Also (below):
;;
;;  * (@> "History Enhancements") for new ways to use the standard history
;;    lists with Icicles
;;
;;  * (@> "Customizing Key Bindings") for how to change the default Icicles
;;    key bindings
;;
;;    Note: If you are thinking about customizing key bindings just so
;;    you can use `up' `down' for the minibuffer history, consider
;;    setting `icicle-cycling-respects-completion-mode-flag' to t
;;    instead; it should give you the behavior you want.  If you still
;;    want to customize keys to do this, then see
;;    (@> "Customizing Key Bindings"), below.
 
;;(@* "Apropos Completions")
;;
;;  Apropos Completions
;;  -------------------
;;
;;  Icicles offers a new way to complete your partial input in the
;;  minibuffer.  Instead of considering the string of input characters
;;  to be the prefix of various complete names, you can look for names
;;  that match that string anywhere.  This is the single most
;;  important feature that Icicles offers.
;;
;;  This is similar in effect to using command `apropos' to find
;;  "apropos completions" of a string (except it works also for file
;;  and buffer names), so that's the term I use for this.  The more
;;  correct characterization of this is that of the previous
;;  paragraph, however: names that match the given string.
;;
;;  Just as with prefix completion, Icicles lets you cycle among the
;;  apropos candidates.  To do this, you use keys `next' and `prior'
;;  (or `C-v' and `M-v').  The root that was completed is underlined
;;  in the minibuffer completion candidate.
;;
;;  For example, suppose you use `M-x' to enter a command.  You don't
;;  remember the exact command name, but it has something to do with
;;  lines, so you type `M-x line', then hit `next' repeatedly, until
;;  you see the right "line" command - `transpose-lines', perhaps.
;;  Prefix completion cannot find this command, because "line" is not
;;  a prefix of "transpose-lines".
;;
;;  Because `M-x' expects a command name, only command names are
;;  inserted into the minibuffer as the apropos-completion candidates
;;  for `M-x'.  Likewise, in other contexts, where names of other
;;  kinds of object are expected, apropos completion inserts only
;;  names of objects of the appropriate type.  Prefix completion works
;;  the same way.
;;
;;  For example, using `next' and `prior' with `C-x b at' lets you
;;  cycle through all buffers (such as `*scratch*') that have "at" in
;;  their name - only buffer names appear as candidates.
;;
;;  Apropos completion uses a regular expression (regexp) as its input
;;  string.  You can type `M-x \bes', for instance, to find commands
;;  with "es" at the start of a word within the command name (`\b'
;;  matches the start of a word).  It will find `eshell-test' and
;;  `color-theme-blue-eshell', but not `count-lines' - "es" does not
;;  start a word in `count-lines'.  Similarly, for file names, buffer
;;  names, and so on.
;;
;;  Prefix completion is actually a special case of apropos
;;  completion, where the regexp starts with "^".  (That is not how it
;;  is implemented, however.)
;;
;;  What if you want to see the list of all completion candidates that
;;  match the minibuffer input? Instead of cycling candidates blindly,
;;  just hit `S-TAB' (Shift TAB) at any time to display the matching
;;  candidates in pop-up buffer *Completions*.  This is analogous to
;;  `TAB' for prefix completion.
;;
;;  Everything said above about the *Completions* buffer for prefix
;;  completion is also true for apropos completion.  It is updated to
;;  reflect the current set of matching candidates, and the current
;;  completion is highlighted.  The root that was completed is
;;  highlighted within each candidate (first occurrence only).  Root
;;  highlighting is more important in the case of apropos completion,
;;  because the match position is different in different candidates.
;;  In the case of apropos completion, the root is not the input
;;  string, taken literally, but the part of a candidate that the
;;  input matches.  See (@> "*Completions* Display"), below, for additional
;;  ways to use the minibuffer with *Completions*.
;;
;;  Regexp matching is perhaps the most powerful feature of Icicles.
;;  Enjoy!  Explore!  You can at any time switch back and forth
;;  between prefix completion (`down', `up'), apropos completion
;;  (`next', `prior'), and history traversal (`M-n', `M-p').
 
;;(@* "Longest-Common-Match Completion")
;;
;;  Longest-Common-Match Completion
;;  -------------------------------
;;
;;  Apropos (regexp) matching and prefix completion each match a
;;  pattern against a completion candidate.  This operation concerns
;;  only a single candidate; it does not take into account the fact
;;  that there are others.  Since the matching operation is repeated
;;  anyway for each candidate, however, we can also find the longest
;;  string that includes the same match (apropos or prefix) for all
;;  candidates.
;;
;;  For prefix completion, Emacs already completes your input to the
;;  longest common prefix match.  Icicles extends this notion to
;;  apropos completion.
;;
;;  For example, if you enter `M-x minib' and hit `TAB', Emacs
;;  completes your input to `minibuffer', which is the longest prefix
;;  match for `minib' among all command names.  The actual string that
;;  matches prefix `minib' among all candidates is, itself, `minib'.
;;
;;  If you hit `S-TAB', then each matching candidate contains a
;;  substring that matches your regexp input `minib'.  In this case,
;;  that substring is `minib', just as in the prefix-matching case.
;;  And, as in the prefix case, each matching candidate also includes
;;  a longer substring, `minibuffer', which includes what your input
;;  matches for each candidate.
;;
;;  Icicles replaces your regexp input in the minibuffer by the
;;  longest such string.  Icicles highlights this longest common match
;;  in buffer *Completions* using face
;;  `icicle-common-match-highlight-Completions' (magenta foreground,
;;  by default).  What your input matches directly is highlighted in
;;  *Completions* using face `icicle-match-highlight-Completions' (red
;;  foreground, by default).
;;
;;  It is of course possible that a given regexp match different
;;  candidates differently, so that there is no common match.  In that
;;  case, only the individual matches are highlighted in *Completions*
;;  - you will see only red, no magenta, highlighting.  For example,
;;  if your regexp input is `min.*buf' then various different
;;  substrings (such as `minibuf' from `minibuffer-complete' and
;;  `mint-truncate-buf' from `comint-truncate-buffer') are highlighted
;;  in red, but these share no common substring.
;;
;;  You will also see only red highlighting if what your input matches
;;  directly is the same as the longest common match.  For example, if
;;  a function `moccur-regexp-read-from-minibuf' is defined (it is in
;;  library `color-moccur.el'), and your input to `C-h f' is
;;  `min[^-]*buf', then only `minibuf' is highlighted in red.
;;
;;  Longest-common-match completion is convenient, but when
;;  apropos-completing you often need to try variants of a regexp,
;;  editing it and observing which candidates match in *Completions*,
;;  until you get the regexp right.  Longest-common-match completion
;;  has the disadvantage that you lose your regexp as input, which
;;  makes it hard to edit it!  To retrieve it, simply use `C-l'
;;  (`icicle-retrieve-last-input') in the minibuffer.  Repeat `C-l' as
;;  needed.  Set option `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-flag' to
;;  nil to turn off longest-common-match completion altogether, if you
;;  prefer.
 
;;(@* "Progressive Completion")
;;
;;  Progressive Completion
;;  ----------------------
;;
;;  The best way to explain this feature is to use a familiar analogy.
;;  Unix or GNU/Linux command `grep' takes a regular-expression
;;  argument, and matches it against lines in files.  A common idiom
;;  that people use is to chain, or cascade, multiple calls to `grep',
;;  using the output of one as the input to the next.  For example:
;;
;;    grep plant *.txt | grep food | grep mineral
;;
;;  The output of the search for "plant" is used as the input for the
;;  search for "food", and the output of that search serves as the
;;  input for the search for "mineral".  The order of the three
;;  component searches can make a difference in terms of performance,
;;  but not in terms of the result, which is always the set of lines
;;  in files *.txt that match "plant" AND "food" AND "mineral", in any
;;  order.  Each of the `grep' operations defines a set of matches,
;;  and the chain of `grep' operations effects the intersection of
;;  those sets.
;;
;;  Of course, you could try to accomplish the same thing with a
;;  single call to `grep' using a complex regexp.  But why would you?
;;
;;  The same idea is behind the Icicles feature of progressive
;;  completion: instead of trying to come up with a complex regexp
;;  that does what you want, try getting there a step at a time:
;;
;;   1. Match an input regexp against the set of all possible
;;      completions.
;;
;;   2. Narrow the set of matched candidates by matching them against
;;      another input regexp.
;;
;;   3. Narrow those results down by matching them against a third
;;      input regexp.
;;
;;   4... And so on.
;;
;;  During completion, `M-*' is bound in the minibuffer to command
;;  `icicle-narrow-candidates', which prompts for a new regexp and
;;  matches it against the current set of completion candidates.
;;
;;  For example, suppose that you want to know about a function that
;;  Emacs has that deletes the character to the left of point (that
;;  is, backward).  You don't recall if it's `delete-character-back',
;;  `delete-backward-char', `character-delete-backward', or whatever.
;;  You take a guess that the name contains `delete', `char', and
;;  `back'.
;;
;;   1. `C-h f char S-TAB' displays function names that contain
;;      `char'.
;;
;;   2. `M-* delete' narrows that set of function names to those that
;;      also contain `delete'.
;;
;;   3. `M-* back' narrows the set of matching names further, to those
;;      that also contain `back'.
;;
;;  This displays a list of functions like this in *Completions* (your
;;  list might be somewhat different):
;;
;;    backward-delete-char        backward-delete-char-untabify
;;    delete-backward-char        icicle-backward-delete-char-untabify
;;    icicle-delete-backward-char
;;    quail-conversion-backward-delete-char
;;
;;  Then, of course, you can pick one (or you can use `C-M-next'
;;  repeatedly to view the doc of each of these functions in turn -
;;  see (@> "Get Help on Candidates")).
;;
;;  You get the idea.  This feature is both very simple to use and
;;  very useful.  It's easy to appreciate using multiple simple
;;  matching steps (regexp or not) instead of a single regexp.  Try it
;;  once, and you'll be hooked.
;;
;;  `M-*' works with both prefix completion and apropos completion.
;;  You can first use `TAB' to require the target to start with some
;;  string, and then use `M-*' to specify other patterns that parts of
;;  it must also match.  However, it of course makes no sense to use
;;  `TAB' instead of `S-TAB' after you use `M-*': once you've said
;;  that the target must start with "fo" there is no sense saying that
;;  it also starts with "ti"!
;;
;;  For lack of a better name, I call this feature "progressive
;;  completion".  If the name "incremental completion" (= icompletion)
;;  were not already taken to mean incremental completion *help*
;;  (which performs no completion), then that might be a good name for
;;  this.  This might also be called "stepped", "cascaded", or
;;  "piecewise" completion.
;;
;;  Another possible name for it would be "multiple completion", but I
;;  use that to stand for simultaneous (parallel) completion of
;;  multiple parts of a compound target, which is something different
;;  (see (@> "Multi-Completions"), below).  Progressive completion is a set
;;  of mini-completions that are wired in series, not in parallel.
;;
;;  Note that when you use `M-*' in the minibuffer, it calls
;;  `completing-read', which creates a recursive minibuffer.  That is,
;;  the minibuffer depth is increased.  In vanilla Emacs there is no
;;  indicator of the current minibuffer depth, and this can sometimes
;;  be disorienting.  Each time you use `M-*' you push down one level
;;  of minibuffer recursion (that is, minibuffer depth is
;;  incremented).  Each time you use, say, `C-g', you pop up one level
;;  of minibuffer recursion (that is, minibuffer depth is
;;  decremented).
;;
;;  If you use my library `oneonone.el', then you get visual feedback
;;  on the current minibuffer depth.  One-On-One Emacs gives you a
;;  standalone minibuffer frame, and it changes the background hue
;;  (color) of that frame slightly with each change in minibuffer
;;  depth.  This is especially helpful with Icicles, where use of
;;  `M-*' is common.
;;
;;  Note too that there is a slight difference in behavior between
;;  Icicles commands and some other Emacs commands when you accept
;;  input after `M-*'.  When possible, Icicles accepts your input and
;;  passes it immediately to the top level, bypassing any intermediate
;;  recursive minibuffer levels that are waiting for inupt.  However,
;;  Emacs commands that are defined with literal-string `interactive'
;;  specs, such as (interactive "fFile: "), do not use
;;  `completing-read' or `read-file-name', so there is no way for
;;  Icicles to take this shortcut with them.  In that case, you will
;;  simply need to hit `RET' again to accept your input at each
;;  recursive minibuffer level, until you get back to the top level.
;;  Sorry for this inconvenience!  If you are an Emacs-Lisp
;;  programmer, note that this is one reason to use `completing-read'
;;  and `read-file-name' when you write commands that use completion.

;;(@* "Moving Between the Minibuffer and Other Buffers")
;;
;;  Moving Between the Minibuffer and Other Buffers
;;  -----------------------------------------------
;;
;;  Sometimes, when the minibuffer is active, you might want to move
;;  the cursor and focus from the minibuffer back to the original
;;  buffer from which you activated the minibuffer.  When you are in
;;  Icicle mode, the `pause' key is bound (by default) to command
;;  `icicle-switch-to/from-minibuffer', which does that.  This lets
;;  you start minibuffer input (with or without completion), and then
;;  interrupt it to search, edit, and so on, in the original buffer.
;;  This same command (bound to `pause') then lets you switch back to
;;  the minibuffer - it acts as a toggle for the input focus; go back
;;  and forth as much as you like.
;;
;;  This can be especially useful when you use multi-commands (see
;;  (@> "Multi-Commands"), below).  In that case, you often keep the
;;  minibuffer active for completion while performing multiple
;;  completion actions.  It can be handy to interrupt this to perform
;;  some normal editing or search, and then resume multi-command
;;  actions.
;;
;;  Another use for this feature is to select text in the original
;;  buffer and then insert it in the minibuffer.  See also 
;;  (@> "Inserting Text Found Near the Cursor"), above, for another way to
;;  do that.
;;
;;  A somewhat related toggle is available using the `insert' key.
;;  This lets you switch the focus between the minibuffer and buffer
;;  *Completions*.  See (@> "*Completions* Display"), below, for more
;;  information.
 
;;(@* "Inserting a Regexp from a Variable")
;;
;;  Inserting a Regexp from a Variable
;;  ----------------------------------
;;
;;  Regexps are powerful, but they can sometimes be complex to compose
;;  and hard to remember once composed.  A shortcut is to compose a
;;  regexp that you want to use and assign it to an Emacs variable.
;;  Then, whenever you are typing input in the minibuffer, you can use
;;  `C-=' (bound to command `icicle-insert-string-from-variable') to
;;  insert the regexp.
;;
;;  If you use `C-u C-=' (provide a prefix argument) then you are
;;  prompted for the variable to use.  You can use any variable.
;;  Without `C-u', the default variable is used (no prompting),
;;  `icicle-input-string'.  So, for example, if `icicle-input-string'
;;  had value "[a-zA-Z]+" then it would match any completion candidate
;;  composed only of letters.  You can customize
;;  `icicle-input-string'.
;;
;;  For convenience, instead of using Lisp evaluation of a sexp such
;;  as (setq icicle-input-string "[a-zA-Z]+") or (setq my-var ".*"),
;;  you can use Icicles command `icicle-save-string-to-variable' to
;;  save a regexp to a variable.  You are prompted for the regexp to
;;  save.  Just as for `icicle-insert-string-from-variable', with a
;;  prefix argument you are prompted for the variable to use; with no
;;  prefix argument the regexp is saved to variable
;;  `icicle-input-string'.
;;
;;  This shortcut feature is especially convenient for use with
;;  command `icicle-search' - you can use it to search text for
;;  sentences, paragraphs, file names, URLs, dates, times, function
;;  definitions, and any other text entities that you can specify by
;;  regexp.  Create a library of regexp-valued variables that are
;;  useful to you, and use `C-=' to quickly access them in
;;  `icicle-search'.  See (@> "Search Enhancements"), below, for more
;;  information.
;;
;;  See Also: (@> "Inserting Text Found Near the Cursor"), above.
 
;;(@* "What About Special-Character Conflicts?")
;;
;;  What About Special-Character Conflicts?
;;  ---------------------------------------
;;
;;  Regular-expression syntax treats some characters specially, but
;;  some of these special characters have another special meaning in
;;  Emacs when used with file-name inputs.  What about the conflict
;;  between interpreting characters such as `$', `\', `.', `?', and
;;  `*' as 1) regexp special characters and 2) special characters for
;;  file-name input?  For example, when inputting a file name, should
;;  `*' be treated as a regexp multiple-occurrences operator or as a
;;  file-name wildcard?
;;
;;  In Emacs file-name input:
;;
;;  - `$' can be used to prefix environment variables.
;;
;;  - `*' and `?' can be used as wildcards, effectively inputting
;;    multiple file names at once.
;;
;;  - `.' and `..' can be used to navigate a directory hierarchy.
;;
;;  - `\' is a directory separator, like `/', on MS Windows, at least.
;;
;;  Icicles handles the conflict by interpreting such characters as
;;  regexp special characters only during input completion and cycling
;;  - and then only if you do not escape them (with `\').  If present
;;  in the input when you finally accept it (using `RET'), they take
;;  on their normal Emacs meanings for file-name input:
;;  environment-variable prefix, wildcard, directory abbreviation, or
;;  directory separator.
;;
;;  That is, whenever there is a potential conflict of interpretation,
;;  the regexp meaning is used for completion and cycling, and the
;;  standard interpretation for file-name input is used for accepting
;;  the input.  So, for example, to get the wildcard interpretation of
;;  `*', just forego regexp completion and cycling.  And vice versa:
;;  forego the wildcard interpretation to use regexp completion and
;;  cycling.
;;
;;  This is in any case the behavior of vanilla Emacs as well.  If, in
;;  vanilla Emacs, you use `ici*' or `ici*.el' as input to `find-file'
;;  and hit `TAB', there is no completion available.  File-name
;;  globbing and completion are independent.
;;
;;  Note: Because `?' is useful in regexp syntax, the standard Emacs
;;        minibuffer binding of `?', which just displays the
;;        completion-candidates list, is not used in Icicles.  In
;;        Icicles, `?' self-inserts in the minibuffer, like any other
;;        printable character.  (Use `TAB' or `S-TAB' to display the
;;        list.)  In standard Emacs, you must quote `?' or
;;        copy-and-paste it, to insert it in the minibuffer for use as
;;        a file-name wildcard.
;;
;;  The interpretation conflict for `\' (on MS Windows) is not really
;;  a problem, anyway.  Although you cannot use a backslash (`\') as a
;;  directory separator during completion and cycling, you can always
;;  use a slash (`/') instead - even on MS Windows.  Just break with
;;  MS-Windows syntax, and get in the habit of using `/' as the
;;  directory-separator character.
;;
;;  Even if you use only slash, not backslash, as a directory
;;  separator when inputting, however, it's possible that you could
;;  run into some trouble (on MS Windows) - you might (knowingly or
;;  not) use `\' as a directory separator in the values of environment
;;  variables that you use as part of file-name input.  Because the
;;  expanded input is treated as a regexp by apropos completion, you
;;  should use only prefix completion with input that includes
;;  environment variables, if their expansions include backslashes.
;;
;;  The interpretation conflict for `$' is also not a real problem.
;;  You can get the effect of both interpretations of `$' at the same
;;  time, because Icicles recognizes that `$' at the end of input
;;  cannot be an environment-variable prefix.  This means, for
;;  example, that you can use a pattern such as `$HOME.*t$' to match
;;  the files in your home directory whose names end in `t'.
;;
;;  The first `$' here is not treated specially during regexp matching
;;  and cycling; the environment variable `$HOME' is expanded by the
;;  shell to a directory name.  The second `$' is treated as the
;;  regexp special character that matches at the end of a line.
;;
;;  Tip: Because slash (`/') is about the only non-word syntax
;;       character that is likely to appear in file-name completions,
;;       you can usually use `\W$' to match only directories (by
;;       matching the `/' at the end of their names).  `\W' is the
;;       regexp pattern that matches any character that does not
;;       appear in words.
;;
;;  Finally, you can toggle interpretation vs escaping of regexp
;;  special characters at any time using `C-`' in the minibuffer
;;  (command `icicle-toggle-regexp-quote').  Escaping special
;;  characters this way means they are no longer special; they simply
;;  match themselves.  This has the effect of reducing apropos
;;  completion to simple substring completion.  If you never want to
;;  use regexp matching (*not* recommended!), you can customize user
;;  option `icicle-regexp-quote-flag', setting it to non-nil.

;;
;;  Alternative Libraries: Other Methods of Choosing Default Values
;;  ---------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  There are other libraries that give you alternative ways to pick a
;;  candidate default value.  There are, for instance, many libraries
;;  that provide ways to switch buffers.  Some of these present
;;  candidates in the minibuffer and choose one as soon as you type
;;  enough of its name to select it unambiguously - without your
;;  needing to confirm your choice (with `RET', for example).  Library
;;  `ido.el' is an example of such a library.  Library `iswitchb.el'
;;  is another such library; it is specialized for choosing a buffer.
;;
;;  Choosing without confirming can be very quick, but I prefer to
;;  confirm a choice.  In any case, you can also use Icicles to choose
;;  without confirming, if you wish - see (@> "Multi-Commands"), below.
;;  See also (@> "Exiting the Minibuffer Without Confirmation") for how to
;;  obtain the complete-and-exit behavior of library `iswitchb.el'.
;;
;;  The main reason I prefer Icicles is because of its generality.
;;  You use the same input, cycling, and completion method for
;;  everything.  There is no need to be familiar with one method for
;;  switching buffers, another method for choosing a command, another
;;  for choosing a variable, and so on.  Library `ido.el' is quite
;;  general too, but perhaps a little less so.
;;
;;  Also, I like to be able to edit the value in the minibuffer.  For
;;  instance, in a situation where you are not required to enter one
;;  of the default values (e.g. no REQUIRE-MATCH argument to
;;  `completing-read'), you can use completion to retrieve a default
;;  value that is similar to what you want to enter, then edit it and
;;  hit `RET' to submit the actual value you want.  Library `ido.el'
;;  does have an "edit" command or mode, but I find Icicles better for
;;  letting me edit input.
;;
;;  Icicles has many additional features that are not available in
;;  other libraries (see below), but its main advantage is its
;;  generality: you use the same user interface for input of any kind.
 
;;(@* "Exiting the Minibuffer Without Confirmation: `S-RET'")
;;
;;  Exiting the Minibuffer Without Confirmation: `S-RET'
;;  ----------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  Normally, if you exit the minibuffer with input that only
;;  partially matches a completion candidate, the value you input is
;;  exactly what you typed.  That is, exiting does not automatically
;;  complete your input - what you type is what you get.  This is
;;  desirable most of the time, because it lets you input a value that
;;  does not correspond to any of the completion candidates.  This is
;;  how, for instance, you can use `C-x C-f' to open a new file or
;;  `C-x b' to create a new buffer.
;;
;;  However, some people prefer to limit input to the available
;;  completion candidates.  This can be handy in the case of switching
;;  to a buffer, for instance.  If you have a buffer named
;;  `new-ideas.txt', you might like to be able to type only `new'
;;  followed by `RET', and not have to first complete the input text.
;;  This is the behavior of libraries `ido.el' and `iswitchb.el'.
;;
;;  It is the command you use that decides whether `RET' first
;;  completes your input before exiting the minibuffer.  This is done
;;  in the command definition by providing a non-nil REQUIRE-MATCH
;;  argument to function `completing-read', which prompts you and
;;  reads your input, possibly completing it.
;;
;;  If you use standard Emacs command `switch-to-buffer' then `RET'
;;  does not behave this way; it simply accepts your input, `new', and
;;  creates a new buffer with that name.  
;;
;;  By default, Icicles command `icicle-buffer', not
;;  `switch-to-buffer', is bound to `C-x b' in Icicle mode.  The
;;  default behavior of `icicle-buffer' is the same as the behavior of
;;  `switch-to-buffer' with respect to `RET'.  However, you can obtain
;;  the complete-and-exit `RET' behavior with `icicle-buffer' by
;;  setting option `icicle-buffer-require-match-flag' to
;;  `partial-match-ok'.  This value overrides the REQUIRE-MATCH
;;  argument to `completing-read', in effect forcing it to `t'.
;;
;;  Whenever completion *requires* a match against one of the
;;  completion candidates (typically, an existing file or buffer
;;  name), you can complete and exit the minibuffer all at once, with
;;  only partial input in the minibuffer, by using `RET'.  But what
;;  about apropos completion?  Simply use `S-RET'
;;  (`icicle-apropos-complete-and-exit') instead of `RET': `RET' is
;;  standard in Emacs and uses prefix completion; `S-RET' is specific
;;  to Icicles and uses apropos completion.  For example, you can type
;;  `idea' followed by `S-RET' to switch to buffer `new-ideas.txt'.
;;
;;  Note: If you set user option `icicle-bind-top-level-commands-flag'
;;  to nil, then `C-x b' remains bound to `switch-to-buffer', even in
;;  Icicle mode.
 
;;(@* "*Completions* Display")
;;
;;  *Completions* Display
;;  ---------------------
;;
;;  Icicles adds a few enhancements to the *Completions* display, for
;;  convenience.  The following apply whenever buffer *Completions* is
;;  displayed:
;;
;;  1. When you cycle completions in the minibuffer, the current
;;     candidate is highlighted in *Completions*.
;;
;;  2. You can use the `insert' key to move back and forth between the
;;     minibuffer and *Completions*.  In each direction, the current
;;     candidate is tracked in the destination buffer.  For example,
;;     if the candidate in the minibuffer is `foobar', after you hit
;;     `insert' the cursor is on `foobar' in *Completions*.  In the
;;     other direction, if the cursor is on `foobar' in *Completions*,
;;     after you hit `insert' the current input in the minibuffer is
;;     `foobar'.
;;
;;  3. In buffer *Completions*, you can use the arrow keys to navigate
;;     among the candidate completions.  The current candidate (under
;;     the cursor) is highlighted.
;;
;;  4. *Completions* can also serve as a new kind of icompletion help
;;     - see (@> "Icompletion"), below.
;;
;;  5. You can choose multiple candidates during completion, by
;;     clicking them with `mouse-2' while holding the Control key
;;     pressed.  See (@> "Multi-Commands"), below.
;;
;;  6. Icicles varies the number of columns used to display completion
;;     candidates, for a better fit.
;;
;;  7. Icicles dynamically resizes the *Completions* window
;;     vertically, to fit the current set of completion candidates.
;;     The window is not resized, however, if buffer *Completions*
;;     appears in its own frame.  (It is also not resized in Emacs
;;     releases prior to 21.)
;;
;;     You can control this automatic resizing generally or on a
;;     per-command basis:
;;
;;     * User option `icicle-Completions-window-max-height' is the
;;       maximum number of lines to show in the *Completions* window.
;;
;;     * You can override the behavior of option
;;       `icicle-Completions-window-max-height' for any given command,
;;       by setting property `icicle-Completions-window-max-height' on
;;       the command symbol to a different maximum window height
;;       value.  This property value is predefined for commands, such
;;       as `icicle-buffer' and `icicle-find-file', that don't involve
;;       the content of the current buffer during completion.  A large
;;       value is used for these commands, so that nearly all of the
;;       frame real estate is given to the *Completions* window.
;;
;;     For example, you can use this code to set the maximum
;;     *Completions* height for command `foo' to 100 and turn off
;;     per-command control of the height for command `bar'.  If you
;;     use such code, evaluate it after you load Icicles.
;;
;;       (put 'foo 'icicle-Completions-window-max-height 100)
;;       (put 'bar 'icicle-Completions-window-max-height nil)
;;
;;  There are lots of Icicles features that enhance the display and
;;  behavior of *Completions* in some way.  Read on...

;;
;;  Icompletion
;;  -----------
;;
;;  Emacs incremental completion, or icompletion, provided by standard
;;  library `icomplete.el', displays matching prefix completions in
;;  the minibuffer.  This display is updated incrementally as you type
;;  characters.  In spite of the name, icompletion does not, in fact,
;;  provide any completion; it provides completion help, letting you
;;  know which (prefix) completions are available.
;;
;;  Icicles enhances Emacs icompletion in two ways:
;;
;;  1. It works with library `icomplete+.el' to provide minibuffer
;;     feedback on the number of completion candidates.
;;
;;  2. It provides a new kind of icompletion, using buffer
;;     *Completions*.
;;
;;(@* "icomplete+.el Displays the Number of Other Prefix Candidates")
;;  ** icomplete+.el Displays the Number of Other Prefix Candidates **
;;
;;  Library `icomplete+.el' enhances `icomplete.el' in various ways.
;;  One of these ways is to complement Icicles by displaying the
;;  number of other prefix-completion candidates when cycling.  This
;;  number is displayed whenever you change direction when cycling.
;;  For example:
;;
;;      M-x forward-line   [Matched]  (13 more)
;;
;;  Like `icomplete.el', `icomplete+.el' provides help for only prefix
;;  completions, not apropos completions.  (Reminder: There is no
;;  icompletion for file-name completion - see standard library
;;  `icomplete.el'.)
;;
;;(@* "Icompletion in *Completions*: Apropos and Prefix Completion")
;;  ** Icompletion in *Completions*: Apropos and Prefix Completion **
;;
;;  Buffer *Completions* shows you the current set of candidates for
;;  either prefix or apropos completion.  Together, user options
;;  `icicle-incremental-completion-flag',
;;  `icicle-incremental-completion-delay', and
;;  `icicle-incremental-completion-threshold' control incremental
;;  updating of *Completions*.
;;
;;  If `icicle-incremental-completion-flag' is non-nil, then
;;  *Completions* is automatically updated when you change your input
;;  in the minibuffer - that is, with each character that you type or
;;  delete.  This is another form of icompletion, unique to Icicles.
;;  It uses buffer *Completions*, instead of the minibuffer, to show
;;  the completion help.
;;
;;  The particular non-nil value of
;;  `icicle-incremental-completion-flag' determines when *Completions*
;;  is displayed and updated.  The default value, t, means that
;;  *Completions* is updated only if it is already displayed.  Use t
;;  if you don't want *Completions* to be too intrusive but you want
;;  it to provide the most help when you ask for help (via `TAB' or
;;  `S-TAB').
;;
;;  Any other non-nil value displays and updates *Completions*
;;  whenever there is more than one completion candidate.  That can be
;;  more helpful, but it can also be more distracting.  A value of nil
;;  turns off automatic updating altogether - *Completions* is then
;;  displayed only upon demand.  I find that t represents a good
;;  compromise, providing help when I ask for it, and then continuing
;;  to help until I've finished choosing a candidate.
;;
;;  Option `icicle-incremental-completion-delay' is the number of
;;  seconds to wait before updating *Completions* incrementally.  It
;;  has an effect only when the number of completion candidates is
;;  greater than `icicle-incremental-completion-threshold'.  This
;;  delay can improve performance when there are many candidates.  It
;;  lets you type ahead before any redisplay occurs; otherwise,
;;  redisplay occurs for each character you type or delete.
;;
;;  You can toggle incremental completion at any time (changing
;;  `icicle-incremental-completion-flag' between nil and t) using
;;  command `icicle-toggle-incremental-completion', which is bound to
;;  `C-#' in the minibuffer.  If the number of completion candidates
;;  is very large, then use `C-#' to toggle incremental completion off
;;  - that will save time by not updating *Completions*.  See also
;;  (@> "Dealing With Large Candidate Sets"), below, for other ways to deal
;;  with a large number of candidates.
;;
;;  There are several advantages of using *Completions* for
;;  icompletion, as opposed to the minibuffer:
;;
;;  1. Many more candidates can be displayed in *Completions* than can
;;     be displayed by standard icompletion, which uses the minibuffer
;;     for feedback.
;;
;;  2. Standard (minibuffer) icompletion provides feedback only on
;;     matches for prefix completion.  If you use both standard
;;     icompletion and Icicles icompletion, you can have incremental
;;     help for both prefix completion and apropos completion at the
;;     same time, one in the minibuffer and the other in
;;     *Completions*.
;;
;;  3. The other Icicles *Completions* features are available for the
;;     current set of matching candidates: cycling, highlighting of
;;     match root, highlighting of previously used candidates, and so
;;     on.  See (@> "*Completions* Display"), above.
 
;;(@* "Sorting Candidates and Removing Duplicates")
;;
;;  Sorting Candidates and Removing Duplicates
;;  ------------------------------------------
;;
;;  By default, completion candidates are presented in buffer
;;  *Completions* in alphabetic order.  This is also the order of
;;  cycling among candidates.  Also by default, duplicate candidates
;;  are removed as completion choices.
;;
;;  Some commands however, impose different orders, which are
;;  appropriate in their particular contexts, and some commands do not
;;  remove duplicates.  For example, command `icicle-search' (`C-`')
;;  uses completion to navigate among search hits.  The unsorted order
;;  of the hit occurrences in the buffer is retained, as are duplicate
;;  matches.  Although some search-hit candidates might have the same
;;  text, they are located at different buffer positions.
;;
;;  For a small minority of commands such as `icicle-search', the
;;  candidate order is fixed.  The completion candidates you see in
;;  buffer *Completions* are just names for (invisible) candidate
;;  objects that contain additional information (buffer and buffer
;;  position, in the case of `icicle-search').  Different such objects
;;  might have the same completion-candidate name, so it is important
;;  that the order of presentation remain constant.  Icicles picks the
;;  candidate object to use, according to which candidate name you
;;  click with `mouse-2' or which candidate name is current during
;;  cycling.
;;
;;  Commands such as `icicle-search' are the exception.  For most
;;  commands, you can interactively control the order of candidates
;;  and whether duplicates are removed.  Use `C-,' during completion
;;  to choose a different sort order or to turn off sorting altogether
;;  (one of the available sort orders is in fact "turned OFF").  Use
;;  `C-$' to toggle removal of duplicate candidates.  Commands such as
;;  `icicle-search', for which sorting is inappropriate, prevent you
;;  from sorting.
;;
;;(@* "Changing the Sort Order")
;;  ** Changing the Sort Order **
;;
;;  There are a couple of ways to use `C-,' (bound to command
;;  `icicle-change-sort-order').  Its behavior depends on the value of
;;  user option `icicle-change-sort-order-completion-flag', which is
;;  nil by default.  This value means to simply cycle to the next sort
;;  order each time you hit `C-,'.  A non-nil value means to use
;;  completion to choose another sort order.  If you have many
;;  available sort orders, then you might prefer a non-nil value.  In
;;  any case, you can also change this behavior on the fly: using
;;  plain `C-u' (no number) with `C-,' reverses the meaning of
;;  `icicle-change-sort-order-completion-flag' for `C-,'.
;;
;;  However, a numeric prefix argument, such as `C-9', means to simply
;;  reverse the direction of the current sort order; it invokes
;;  command `icicle-reverse-sort-order'.  For example, if candidates
;;  are sorted alphabetically from A to Z, then `C-9 C-,' flips the
;;  sort order, so that from then on sorting is from Z to A.
;;
;;  In addition to the current sort order, which is defined by the
;;  value of user option `icicle-sort-function', an alternative sort
;;  order is available at all times.  It is the value of option
;;  `icicle-alternative-sort-function'.  By default, this sorts
;;  candidates into two alphabetical groups: those previously used,
;;  followed by those not yet used.
;;
;;  Just as you can choose a different current sort order using `C-,',
;;  so you can choose a different alternative sort order using `M-,'.
;;
;;  How do you actually use the alternative sort order?  Use `C-M-,'
;;  (command `icicle-toggle-alternative-sorting') to swap the
;;  alternative sort for the current sort.  This is the quickest way
;;  to flip between two sort orders.  If, for example, you set your
;;  alternative sort order to "turned OFF", then this is a quick way
;;  to toggle sorting on and off.
;;
;;  Commands that read buffer names with completion can use another
;;  sort-function user option, `icicle-buffer-sort'.  It has the same
;;  meaning as `icicle-sort-function' for those commands.  It is
;;  provided so that you can customize it separately.  You can also
;;  define buffer configurations that are used for completion: named
;;  sets of buffers, sort functions, and other parameters that control
;;  completion of buffer names.
;;
;;(@* "Defining New Sort Orders")
;;  ** Defining New Sort Orders **
;;
;;  When you use `C-,' or `M-,', the sort orders that you can choose
;;  from are those in user option `icicle-sort-functions-alist'.  You
;;  can customize this option to add or remove available sort orders.
;;  A better way to define a new sort order is to use macro
;;  `icicle-define-sort-command' in your Emacs init file (~/.emacs).
;;  This defines a new Icicles command, named `icicle-sort-ORDER',
;;  where `ORDER' is the name of the new sort order.  The definition
;;  of the "alphabetical" sort order provides an example:
;;
;;    (icicle-define-sort-command "alphabetical" 
;;                                icicle-case-string-less-p
;;      "Sort completion candidates alphabetically.")
;;
;;  The first argument, "alphabetical", is a string naming the new
;;  sort order.  When you change to this sort order, a message says
;;  "Sorting is now alphabetical".  Whatever sort-order name you
;;  provide is used in the message.
;;
;;  The second argument is the actual function used for sorting.  It
;;  can be any function, including a lambda expression.  The function
;;  takes two string arguments and returns non-nil if and only if the
;;  first string sorts before (is "less than") the second.  In this
;;  case, function `icicle-case-string-less-p' is used, which compares
;;  its two arguments alphabetically (lexicographically).  The third
;;  argument is the doc string for the new sorting command.
;;
;;  The result of this definition is:
;;
;;  1. The creation of command `icicle-sort-alphabetical'.
;;  2. The addition of an entry for the new sort order in option
;;     `icicle-sort-functions-alist'.  The entry associates sort order
;;     "alphabetical" with comparison function
;;     `icicle-case-string-less-p'.
;;
;;  You can invoke the new sorting command any time using `M-x', but
;;  you can also change to the new sort order using `C-,' (or `M-,')
;;  during minibuffer completion.
;;
;;(@* "Different Sorts for Different Sorts of Uses")
;;  ** Different Sorts for Different Sorts of Uses **
;;
;;  There are many different uses of completion in Emacs, and this
;;  means that sorting candidates needs to be flexible - there cannot
;;  be a single sort order that is useful for all purposes.
;;  Completion, and therefore sorting of completion candidates, needs
;;  to deal with different types of candidates and different numbers
;;  of them, in different contexts.
;;
;;  Icicles predefines several sort functions, and you can easily
;;  define more of your own.  You can choose a different sort at any
;;  time, as mentioned above.  A good sort order can be a big help,
;;  depending on the context.  However, sorting isn't free, and it's
;;  helpful to think for a moment about some of the consequences of
;;  sorting, in terms of performance.
;;
;;  What does a sort function do?  It determines which of two strings
;;  should come first, that is, which is "less than" the other.
;;  During sorting, pairs of candidates are compared using the sort
;;  function.  And each time you change your input by typing or
;;  deleting a character, the new set of matching candidates is sorted
;;  (if `icicle-incremental-completion-flag' is non-nil).
;;
;;  The number of candidates to be sorted depends on how you use
;;  Icicles.  Some Icicles users like to use cycling more and
;;  completion less, which means sorting more candidates.  Other users
;;  favor using completion to narrow down the number of matches (which
;;  I recommend).
;;
;;  If there are many candidates matching your input, then many
;;  comparisons will be made each time the candidate set is sorted.
;;  This means that if your sort function is complex, response can be
;;  slow.  A complex sort function might be OK for sorting a small or
;;  medium set of candidates, but it might not be appropriate for
;;  sorting a very large set.
;;
;;  Only you, as a user, can control which sort makes the best sense
;;  for you in any given situation.  If you are likely to have
;;  zillions of candidates in some context, then you probably will
;;  want to change to a sort that computes quickly.  You can, of
;;  course, even choose not to sort at all, but simple sort
;;  comparisons don't noticeably impact performance, even for a very
;;  large number of candidates.
;;
;;  Icicles could offer a threshold option similar to
;;  `icicle-incremental-completion-threshold' (or it could reuse that
;;  option), and not bother to sort if the number of candidates passed
;;  the threshold, but there can be many sort orders of differing
;;  complexity, so a set of thresholds would really be needed, perhaps
;;  one per sort order.
;;
;;  Rather than having you try to manage such complexity ahead of time
;;  using options, it's better to just let you manage it at completion
;;  time: Choose the sort order with knowledge of the possible
;;  candidate set.  For example, if the set of candidates to sort will
;;  include every file on your file system, then you probably will
;;  want to use a simple sort.  On the other hand, there are
;;  situations where you might nevertheless prefer to wait a few
;;  seconds, in order to perform a complex sort that is of particular
;;  use.
;;
;;  In sum, Icicles keeps it simple, and leaves it up to you to choose
;;  the appropriate sort order for any given context.  This design
;;  choice is one reason why Icicles makes it easy to choose a sort
;;  even while you are completing input - each act of completion is
;;  different.
;;
;;  It can help you choose, however, to know which of the predefined
;;  Icicles sort orders are more complex, and therefore tend to be
;;  slower.  Here they are:
;;
;;    Sort Order                      Sort Function Used
;;    ----------                      ------------------
;;    by previous use alphabetically  icicle-historical-alphabetic-p 
;;    by last use                     icicle-most-recent-first-p 
;;
;;  The reason these sorts are slower is that they check the current
;;  minibuffer history, to see whether, and where, each candidate is
;;  located in the history list.  If you, like I, have very long
;;  history lists, then this can take a while.  I use histories of
;;  virtually unlimited length - I let library `savehist-20+.el' save
;;  all of my histories from one Emacs session to the next.

;;(@* "Get Help on Candidates")
;;
;;  Get Help on Candidates
;;  ----------------------
;;
;;  While you are cycling among completion candidates for input to a
;;  command, you can simultaneously display help on each candidate or
;;  any given candidate.  To show help on each candidate as you cycle,
;;  press and hold the Control and Meta keys while using the vertical
;;  arrow keys (for prefix completion) or the Page Up/Down keys (for
;;  apropos completion).  To show help on any individual candidate,
;;  just navigate to it (cycling or using completion), and hit
;;  `C-M-RET' - or press Control and Meta and click it with `mouse-2'
;;  (`C-M-mouse-2') in buffer *Completions*.
;;
;;  For example, if you use standard command `switch-to-buffer' and
;;  you cycle among candidate buffers with `C-M-down' (prefix
;;  completion), then the major and minor modes of each candidate
;;  buffer are described in buffer *Help* as the buffer name appears
;;  in the minibuffer.
;;
;;  By default, you need not use the Meta key for candidate help; the
;;  same bindings work with just the Control key.  So, for example,
;;  you can click `C-mouse-2' to get help on a candidate or use
;;  `C-next' to cycle candidate help information.  However, Icicles
;;  multi-commands often have a different use for these bindings that
;;  do not include Meta.  It is only by default, when a multi-command
;;  has not bound a more specific action to the plain Control
;;  bindings, that you can use the sans-Meta bindings for help on
;;  candidates.
;;
;;  For example, Icicles binds `M-x', `C-x b', and `C-x C-f' to
;;  multi-commands that execute a command, switch to a buffer, and
;;  open a file, respectively.  If you use only the Control key,
;;  without the Meta key, when choosing candidates for these commands,
;;  you will not get help on the candidates; instead, you will execute
;;  a candidate command, switch to a candidate buffer, and open a
;;  candidate file, respectively.  For more information, see (@>
;;  "Multi-Commands"), below.

;;(@* "Use Candidate Help Like You Use Command `apropos'")

;;  buffer as they appear one by one in the minibuffer.  Or click
;;  individual variable names with `C-M-mouse-2', to display their
;;  documentation.  The standard `apropos' commands show only the
;;  first doc-string line; Icicles shows the complete doc string.
;;
;;  This can be handy, for instance, when you are unsure which of
;;  several similarly named candidates to choose.  Seeing a
;;  candidate's documentation along with its name can help you decide.
;;
;;  You can click links in buffer *Help* to look up more info, and
;;  then resume `C-M-next' where you left off, all without leaving
;;  completion.
;;
;;  This also works with menu items, if you load library
;;  `icicles-menu.el' as well as `icicles.el'.  As you cycle among
;;  matching menu items, the corresponding command documentation is
;;  displayed in *Help*.
;;
;;  Help is available for these types of completion candidates:
;;
;;  * menu items
;;  * commands an other functions
;;  * user options and other variables
;;  * faces
;;  * property lists
;;  * buffers
;;  * files
;;
;;  For more information about the types of candidates and their
;;  associated documentation, see the documentation for command
;;  `icicle-help-on-candidate'.  This command is bound to `C-M-RET',
;;  `C-help', `C-f1', `C-M-mouse-2', and `C-M-RET'.  You can use this
;;  to get help on any completion candidate during completion.  See
;;  also the related help-cycling commands,
;;  `icicle-help-on-next-apropos-candidate' and so on, bound to
;;  `C-M-next', `C-M-prior', `C-M-down', and `C-M-up'.
;;
;;  If you use one-buffer-per-frame (`pop-up-frames' non-nil), then
;;  displaying *Help* in one frame might interfere with viewing
;;  *Completions* in another.  For that reason, the *Completions*
;;  frame is raised to the front.  Also, if user option
;;  `icicle-Completions-frame-at-right-flag' is non-nil (default
;;  value: `t'), then the *Completions* frame is moved to the right,
;;  out of the way, whenever you access help on a candidate.
;;
;;(@* "Other Icicles Apropos Commands")
;;  ** Other Icicles Apropos Commands **
;;
;;  There are also Icicles replacements for the standard Emacs
;;  `apropos' commands.  They act the same, but they also let you see
;;  the list of regexp matches incrementally (as with all Icicles
;;  commands), using `S-TAB'.  If you also use my library
;;  `apropos-fn+var.el', then these Icicles commands take advantage of
;;  the apropos enhancements in that library.
;;
;;  The Icicles apropos commands are: `icicle-apropos',
;;  `icicle-apropos-command', `icicle-apropos-function',
;;  `icicle-apropos-option', `icicle-apropos-variable', and
;;  `icicle-apropos-zippy'.
;;
;;  In addition, Icicles commands `icicle-doc', `icicle-fundoc', and
;;  `icicle-vardoc' provide the functionality of standard Emacs
;;  command `apropos-documentation', but with additional features.
;;  See (@> "Multi-Completions"), below.  You can use command
;;  `icicle-plist' to find symbols with certain property-list keys and
;;  values.
;;
;;  One difference between Icicles apropos commands and the standard
;;  commands, besides the Icicles enhancements already described, is
;;  that (starting with Emacs 22) the standard commands let you input
;;  a set of keywords, as an alternative to inputting a regexp.
;;  Icicles apropos commands do not allow for keyword input, as such.
;;  However, Icicles progressive completion provides a more powerful
;;  way to search with multiple keywords (in fact, multiple regexps) -
;;  you can of course use it with the Icicles apropos commands.  Also,
;;  there are several problems with the standard Emacs apropos
;;  commands, with respect to interpreting your input as either a set
;;  of keywords or a regexp.  Because they allow two very different
;;  syntaxes as input, the standard apropos commands are forced to
;;  make some limiting compromises for keyword searching.
;;
;;  See Also: (@> "Progressive Completion"), above.
 
;;(@* "Multi-Commands")
;;
;;  Multi-Commands
;;  --------------
;;
;;(@* "What Is a Multi-Command?")
;;  ** What Is a Multi-Command? **
;;
;;  A multi-command is a command that lets you make multiple input
;;  choices in a single command execution: a multiple-choice command.
;;  You can choose multiple items from a set of choices, using buffer
;;  *Completions* as a multiple-choice "menu".  (It's not necessary to
;;  display *Completions*, however.)  Instead of asking you "Which
;;  file do you want to delete?", a multi-command asks you, in effect,
;;  "Which file(S) do you want to delete?".
;;
;;  Nothing especially new here.  Any Emacs command could be defined
;;  to use an input loop, asking for file names until you do something
;;  to signal that you're done inputting.  It could provide for
;;  file-name completion by calling `read-file-name' to read your
;;  input.
;;
;;  * But what if you could also filter the domain of discourse on the
;;    fly, so that the candidate files were only those matching a
;;    regular expression (regexp) that you typed? Then, the command
;;    definition would need to provide for that behavior too.
;;
;;  * And what if you could then take the complement of that set of
;;    candidate file names, with respect to the complete set of files
;;    in the directory? Or subtract (exclude) some set of file names
;;    from the set of matching names, to get the set of possible
;;    choices?
;;
;;  * And what if the set of potential candidates at each step (regexp
;;    match, complement, set difference) could also be displayed in a
;;    multiple-choice menu?
;;
;;  For such multi-command functionality you need Icicles.
;;
;;  You can tell if a command is a multi-command when you execute it:
;;  if it is a multi-command, then the prompt is prefixed by `+'.
;;  For example, multi-command `icicle-find-file' uses this prompt:
;;
;;    + File or directory:"
;;
;;  Normal, non-multi-command `find-file' uses this prompt, which has
;;  no `+':
;;
;;    Find file:
;;
;;  Just remember that `+' means that you can choose any number of
;;  inputs.  For a list of predefined Icicles multi-commands, use
;;  `icicle-completion-help' (`C-?' in the minibuffer during
;;  completion) - search for `+' at the beginning of a line.
;;
;;(@* "How Does a Multi-Command Work?")
;;  ** How Does a Multi-Command Work? **
;;
;;  When an Icicles multi-command prompts you for input, you can make
;;  a single choice and press `RET' to confirm it, as usual, or you
;;  can choose any number of completion candidates, using `C-RET' (or
;;  `C-mouse-2') for each.  You can thus act on multiple candidates,
;;  or even multiple times on the same candidate, during the same
;;  execution of the command.  But you don't have to - you can use any
;;  multi-command just as if it were a normal, single-choice command.
;;
;;  For example, command `icicle-delete-file' lets you delete a single
;;  file or a set of files that match your minibuffer input - all in
;;  the same command execution.  If you type no input, then all files
;;  in the current directory match, and you can delete any number of
;;  them individually.  If you type `~$' and hit `S-TAB'
;;  (`apropos-complete'), then all files that end in `~' match, and
;;  you can delete any number of them.  Similarly, command
;;  `icicle-buffer-other-window' lets you display any number of
;;  buffers, and so on.
;;
;;  You make multiple choices this way by cycling through the
;;  candidate completions, as usual, and hitting `C-RET' whenever you
;;  want to choose (act on) the current cycle candidate.  Or, just
;;  press and hold Control while clicking each chosen candidate with
;;  `mouse-2'.
;;
;;  Similarly, you can use `C-next', `C-prior', `C-down', and `C-up'
;;  to both choose (that is, act on) the current candidate and move
;;  forward or backward to the next successive candidate.  You can
;;  thus just hold down the Control key while cycling, to act on each
;;  candidate in turn, if you want.
;;
;;  Instead of, or in addition to, cycling, you can use completion to
;;  get to a particular candidate you want.  No matter how a candidate
;;  is made current, you can choose the current candidate (perform the
;;  action on it) using `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', `C-next', and so on.
;;
;;  As always, hitting `RET' (or `S-RET') ends the command.  For most
;;  multi-commands, hitting `RET' performs the same action as `C-RET',
;;  but it is possible to have a command that acts differently for
;;  `RET' and `C-RET'.  That is the case, for instance, when help is
;;  displayed via `C-RET'.
;;
;;  You can use `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', `C-next', and so on repeatedly
;;  to act multiple times on the same candidate.  A short cut is to
;;  use `C-u' with `C-RET' and the others.  That will work if the
;;  candidate action function is designed to be `C-u' sensitive.  This
;;  is the case for the Icicles multi-commands that read the name of a
;;  command or keyboard macro and execute the command or macro:
;;  `icicle-execute-extended-command' (`M-x'), `icicle-kmacro' (`f5'),
;;  and `icicle-execute-named-keyboard-macro' (`C-x M-e').
;;
;;  So, for example, if you use `C-u 10 C-RET' on command
;;  `forward-char' during `M-x' command completion, the cursor
;;  advances 10 characters.  Another example: `C-x M-e C-u 200 C-RET'
;;  on a keyboard-macro candidate `foo' executes `foo' 200 times.  You
;;  can use all of the numeric prefix argument shortcuts, such as
;;  `M--', `M-7', and `C-6', with the exception of `C--', which has a
;;  different meaning (`icicle-candidate-set-difference') in the
;;  Icicles minibuffer.
;;
;;  You can use `C-g' to exit a multi-command at any time, without
;;  making a final choice using `RET'.  If the actions performed by a
;;  multi-command are easily reversible, `C-g' will often restore
;;  things to the way they were before performing the actions.
;;
;;  Does this `C-RET' stuff sound familiar?  Using a multi-command is
;;  similar to accessing help on a candidate
;;  (see (@> "Get Help on Candidates"), above).  A multi-command is
;;  any command that has a special action defined for use with `C-RET'
;;  (command `icicle-candidate-action') on the current cycle
;;  candidate.  If no such special action is defined, then help on the
;;  candidate is displayed - displaying help is just the default
;;  action for `C-RET', used when no other action is defined.  You can
;;  always access candidate help using the `C-M-' prefix: `C-help',
;;  `C-f1', `C-M-RET', `C-M-mouse-2', `C-M-next', `C-M-prior',
;;  `C-M-down', and `C-M-up'.
;;
;;  You can also cycle among elements of a set, performing actions, if
;;  you use my libraries `doremi.el', `doremi-cmd.el', and
;;  `doremi-frm.el'.  Like Icicles, DoReMi lets you see the effect of
;;  a choice immediately, whenever you make changes.  Each library has
;;  its own advantages and special uses.  Advantages of Icicles
;;  include:
;;
;;    - completion to candidate values
;;    - restoration after making changes, letting you preview changes
;;      without actually applying them

;;
;;  More About Multi-Commands
;;  -------------------------
;;
;;  This section describes a few extras provided for use with
;;  multi-commands.  
;;
;;(@* "Alternative Actions")
;;  ** Alternative Actions **
;;
;;  Just as you can use `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', `C-next', and so on to
;;  invoke a command's action on multiple completion candidates
;;  individually, so you can use `S-C-RET', `S-C-mouse-2', `S-C-next',
;;  and so on to invoke an alternative action that is associated with
;;  the command.  If the main action of a command `my-find-file' is to
;;  open a file, and the alternative action is to print a file, then
;;  you can use `S-C-RET' to print files even as you are completing
;;  the name of a file to be opened.
;;
;;  Currently there are no predefined Icicles commands that use this
;;  feature, but it is likely that there will be in the future.  And
;;  Emacs-Lisp programmers can define their own commands to take
;;  advantage of this feature.
;;
;;(@* "Deleting Objects")
;;  ** Deleting Objects **
;;
;;  When it is defined for a particular command, minibuffer command
;;  `icicle-delete-candidate-object', bound to `S-delete' (that's the
;;  delete key, shifted), deletes the object or objects named by the
;;  completion candidate it operates on.  Which objects are thus
;;  targeted by a given candidate (name) is something that must be
;;  defined by the particular command.
;;
;;  For example, the action associated with Icicles command
;;  `icicle-buffer-other-window', bound to `C-x 4 b', opens buffers
;;  named by the individual candidates you act on (using `C-RET').
;;  But it also kills any buffer that you act on using `S-delete'.
;;  This is not the alternative action for the command (which is bound
;;  to `S-C-RET'); it is the deletion action.  Similarly, command
;;  `icicle-select-region', bound to `C-u C-x C-x', selects regions,
;;  but you can also use `S-delete' with it to remove individual
;;  regions from the list of saved regions, `icicle-region-alist'.
;;
;;  When you use `S-delete' with commands, such as
;;  `icicle-select-region' (`C-u C-x C-x'), which allow duplicate
;;  candidate names that represent different candidate objects, it
;;  deletes only the object associated with the current candidate
;;  (name).  When you use `S-delete' with other commands (which might
;;  or might not allow duplicate candidate names), where it is not
;;  important to distinguish the different objects represented by the
;;  same name, it deletes all objects with the target name.
;;
;;  Some multi-commands define a deletion action; some do not.
;;  Consult the doc for any given command to see if it does.
;;
;;  Note: Although `delete' does not work for file-name candidates in
;;  Emacs releases prior to Emacs 22, `S-delete' does work.
;;  See (@> "Nutshell View of Icicles"), above, for information about
;;  this limitation of `delete'.
;;
;;  If you are an Emacs-Lisp programmer, then you can define your own
;;  multi-commands that provide a deletion action via `S-delete'.
;;  There are two ways to do this:
;;
;;  * Bind `icicle-delete-candidate-object' to a deletion function.
;;    The function must accept a completion candidate string and perform
;;    the deletion.
;;
;;  * Bind `icicle-delete-candidate-object' to a symbol (variable)
;;    whose value is a list of completion-candidate objects.  The
;;    entries in the list must be completion candidates for the
;;    current call to `completing-read', but the list itself need not
;;    be the TABLE argument to `completing-read'.  The list can be an
;;    alist, a list of strings, or a list of symbols.  The object that
;;    corresponds to the current candidate when `S-delete' is invoked
;;    is deleted from the list.  If, in addition, the list variable is
;;    a user option, then the updated list value is saved in the
;;    user's custom file.
;;
;;  For more information about using this feature in Emacs-Lisp code,
;;  see the doc of function `icicle-delete-current-candidate-object'
;;  (`S-delete') and variable `icicle-delete-candidate-object'.
 
;;(@* "Key Completion")
;;
;;  Key Completion
;;  --------------
;;
;;  Here's another weird Icicles feature: completing key sequences,
;;  instead of commands.  (This feature works only for Emacs 22 and
;;  later.)
;;
;;  What on earth for?  Ever want to use one of those myriad `C-x' key
;;  sequences, but forget just what it was?  The standard solution to
;;  that is to use `C-x C-h', to display all of the `C-x' bindings
;;  together with their commands.
;;
;;  OK, but then you have to scroll down the list of bindings,
;;  searching for the command you want, and then use its key binding.
;;  You can use `C-M-s' to search for a substring of the command name,
;;  in case you don't recall the exact name, but why not use Icicles
;;  completion for this?  Why not match against possible key sequences
;;  and commands?
;;
;;(@* "Completing Keys")
;;  ** Completing Keys **
;;
;;  To complete keys in Icicles, start the key sequence as usual, and
;;  then hit `S-TAB' (command `icicle-complete-keys').  For example,
;;  use `C-x' or `C-x 4', and then hit `S-TAB' to complete the prefix
;;  `C-x' or `C-x 4' (or whatever).  You're then completing against
;;  candidates that are composed of two parts, separated by " = ":
;;
;;  * a key binding that completes what you've typed so far -
;;    e.g. `C-j' (that is, `C-x C-j')
;;
;;  * the command it is bound to - e.g. `dired-jump-other-window'
;;
;;  So, for example, this is a single completion candidate:
;;
;;    C-j  =  dired-jump-other-window
;;
;;  You can match your minibuffer input against the key name, the
;;  command name, or both.
;;
;;  Suppose, for instance, that you want to use a version-control
;;  command, and you remember that all such commands are bound to key
;;  sequences that begin with `C-x v'.  You enter as much of the key
;;  sequence as you remember (`C-x v'), and then you hit `S-TAB'.  You
;;  can then use completion (either apropos or prefix) against the
;;  matching key sequences and command names to invoke the right
;;  command.  And, as a bonus, you are reminded of its key sequence.
;;  You can thus use Icicles key completion to execute a command and,
;;  at the same time, learn its key binding.
;;
;;(@* "`S-TAB' Is Everywhere - Start With It")
;;  ** `S-TAB' Is Everywhere - Start With It **
;;
;;  Whenever you are not in the minibuffer or buffer `*Completions*',
;;  key `S-TAB' initiates key completion.  That is, you don't need to
;;  first type part of a key sequence to use it - you can start with
;;  it.  Hit `S-TAB' at any time, and you're completing a key
;;  sequence, even if you haven't yet hit any keys.  This lets you see
;;  all key sequences that are available in a given context.  For
;;  example, in Dired, keys special to that mode are included (and are
;;  highlighted as local bindings -
;;  see (@> "Local Bindings Are Highlighted"), below).
;;
;;  When completing a key sequence, you can type part of a command
;;  name, then hit `S-TAB' to apropos-complete against the command
;;  name.  In this respect, `S-TAB' acts like `M-x', but the key
;;  binding is also part of the completion candidate, so you can also
;;  match key names.
;;
;;(@* "Completing Keys By Name")
;;  ** Completing Keys By Name **
;;
;;  So, just how do you complete input against a set of
;;  binding-plus-command completion candidates?  You can always cycle
;;  among the candidates, of course, and then choose one.  But what
;;  about completion?  Just type text to match candidates, then use
;;  `S-TAB' or `TAB' as usual to complete the text.  Text?  Yes.
;;  Completion candidates are always, ultimately, strings.
;;
;;  Suppose that you type `C-x S-TAB' to show all key sequences that
;;  begin with `C-x'.  You might see a candidate that looks like this:
;;
;;    C-q  =  toggle-read-only
;;
;;  You can then type "C-q" or "d-onl" or any other substring, and
;;  then use `S-TAB' to complete the candidate.  (This second use of
;;  `S-TAB' invokes the command `icicle-apropos-complete', which has
;;  nothing to do with `icicle-complete-keys', which was invoked by
;;  the first `S-TAB'.  The first was invoked outside the minbuffer;
;;  the second was invoked from the minibuffer, during completion.)
;;
;;(@* "Completing Prefix Keys")
;;  ** Completing Prefix Keys **
;;
;;  What happens if the completion candidate is itself a prefix key?
;;  For example, `C-x S-TAB' shows some candidates whose commands are
;;  shown as "...", like this:
;;
;;    4  =  ...      5  =  ...
;;    6  =  ...      C-k  =  ...
;;    ESC  =  ...    RET  =  ...
;;
;;  These represent prefix keys (`C-x 4', `C-x C-k', and so on).  If
;;  you choose such a candidate, then you just continue completing -
;;  buffer `*Completions*' is updated to show the completions of the
;;  compound prefix: `C-x 4', `C-x RET', or whichever you choose.  The
;;  minibuffer prompt shows the completion so far; if you choose
;;  `RET', for instance, then it shows `C-x RET' while prompting you
;;  for the rest of the key sequence.
;;
;;  By default, completion candidates are sorted in buffer
;;  *Completions* with local bindings listed first.  You can use
;;  `C-M-,' at any time during completion to toggle between this order
;;  and sorting with the prefix-key candidates shown first.  You can
;;  use `C-,' at any time to change the sort order among these two
;;  orders and sorting sorting by command name.
;;
;;(@* "Meta Key Bindings")
;;  ** Meta Key Bindings **
;;
;;  If you use `S-TAB' at the top level, and you look for the key
;;  sequence `M-x' or `M-:' or even `M-d', you won't find it.  Meta
;;  key bindings are there, but many of them are disguised as keys in
;;  the `ESC' prefix keymap - e.g. `ESC x' for `M-x'.  That is, you
;;  must first choose the `ESC` prefix key: `ESC  =  ...', and then
;;  choose the `x' key or whatever.  That's just the way Emacs
;;  works.  So, yes, you can use Icicles key completion to execute any
;;  Emacs command, even one that is not bound to a key sequence, and
;;  you can use it to evaluate any EmacsLisp expression.  See
;;  (@> "Three-Key Emacs"), below.
;;
;;(@* "Navigate the Key-Binding Hierarchy")
;;  ** Navigate the Key-Binding Hierarchy **
;;
;;  Choosing a completion candidate such as `C-x  =  ...' effectively
;;  navigates down the key-binding hierachy (prefix-key hierarchy), to
;;  complete against all keys with prefix `C-x'.  Choosing `5  =  ...'
;;  to complete the prefix `C-x' then navigates down another level, to
;;  complete keys that have prefix `C-x 5'.
;;
;;  What about navigating back up the hierarchy, say from the `C-x 5'
;;  keys to the `C-x' keys, or from the `C-x' keys to the keys with no
;;  prefix?  The special completion candidate `..' does that.  By
;;  default, it is always the first candidate in the *Completions*
;;  list.  It is of course not available unless you are completing a
;;  prefix; that is, it is not available at the top level.
;;
;;  This feature means that you can navigate the key-binding hierachy
;;  just as you would navigate the file system hierarchy (using, say,
;;  `C-x C-f') or the menu-bar hierarchy (using library
;;  icicles-menu.el).  (In fact, since menu-bar bindings are also key
;;  bindings, you can also use key completion to navigate the menu-bar
;;  hierarchy - just complete prefix key `menu-bar'!)
;;
;;  Icicles key completion thus provides a general browser for key
;;  bindings, which you can also use to learn about keys and their
;;  associated comands, without necessarily executing them - see
;;  (@> "Key and Command Help"), below.
;;
;;  Gotcha: `S-TAB' uses apropos completion, by default, so remember
;;  that typing `.' matches any character (except a newline).  To
;;  match only `..', either use prefix completion (`TAB') or escape
;;  the regexp special character: `\.\.' (or use `^\.').
;;
;;(@* "Local Bindings Are Highlighted")
;;  ** Local Bindings Are Highlighted **
;;
;;  Sometimes it helps to know which key sequences are local bindings,
;;  that is, bindings that are specific to the current mode.  For
;;  example, Dired mode defines keys specific to Dired buffer, such as
;;  `* %', `% g', and `!'.  To help you distinguish local key bindings
;;  from others (global and minor-mode bindings), local bindings are
;;  highlighted in buffer *Completions* using face
;;  `icicle-special-candidate'.
;;
;;(@* "Completing Keys By Just Hitting Them")
;;  ** Completing Keys By Just Hitting Them **
;;
;;  It may seem odd that you must complete a key sequence by entering
;;  the names of keys, rather than just hitting the keys themselves:
;;  e.g. typing "C-f" rather than hitting `C-f'.  However, if keys
;;  themselves were used for completing, then they could not be used
;;  normally during key-sequence completion.  You could not move the
;;  cursor around the minibuffer using `C-f' or `right' (right arrow),
;;  because those keys would be treated as input for completion.  You
;;  could not use `up' or `down' to cycle among completion candidates
;;  for the same reason.  Likewise, you could not use printing
;;  (self-inserting) keys, such as `a' and `$', to match command
;;  names.  Having to use key names, instead of keys, for completion
;;  is a small price to pay for being able to complete key sequences.
;;
;;  Nevertheless, Icicles also provides a way for you to type key
;;  sequences directly, even if it is something of a workaround:
;;  precede each key with `M-q' (`icicle-insert-key-description') -
;;  think of `q' for "quote".  This inserts the key description of
;;  whatever key you hit next.  This key description (name) can be
;;  used to match key-completion candidates.  So, for example, instead
;;  of typing "C-f", you can hit `M-q' and then hit `C-f'.  The key
;;  description "C-f" is inserted in the minibuffer.  If you use `M-q
;;  C-M-right', then "C-M-right" is inserted.  Try it: `S-TAB M-q
;;  C-M-right' -> "C-M-right".  Then hit `TAB' or `S-TAB' to complete
;;  the candidate all the way to this:
;;
;;    C-M-right  =  enlarge-frame-horizontally
;;
;;  `M-q' is available at all times during minibuffer completion, but
;;  it is designed especially for key completion.
;;
;;  Note: Whether or not angle brackets are used is governed by user
;;  option `icicle-key-descriptions-use-<>-flag'.  By default, this is
;;  nil, so angle brackets are not used, which I think improves
;;  readability.  If you set this to non-nil, then you will see
;;  "<C-M-right>" instead of "C-M-right", both as a completion
;;  candidate and as what is inserted when you use `M-q'.  You can
;;  toggle this option value at any time using `C-<'
;;  (`icicle-toggle-angle-brackets') in the minibuffer.  You can also
;;  provide a prefix argument to `M-q' to flip the behavior of
;;  `icicle-key-descriptions-use-<>-flag' for that occurrence only.
;;
;;(@* "Key and Command Help")
;;  ** Key and Command Help **
;;
;;  That points out another use of key completion, opposite to
;;  learning the bindings of commands: learning the commands bound to
;;  given keys.  In other words, `S-TAB M-q' does both what `C-h w'
;;  (`where-is') does and what `C-h c' (`describe-key-briefly') does.
;;  It also does what `C-h b' (`describe-bindings') does.
;;
;;  The point here is not that `S-TAB M-q' is quicker than `C-h w' or
;;  `C-h c' or `C-h b' - it's not.  The point is that key completion
;;  can be handy in several ways, and it can teach you various things
;;  about keys and commands as you use it.
;;
;;  In addition to this key-completion help about bindings, you can
;;  display help on the commands that are the right sides of the
;;  `S-TAB' completion-candidate equations, by using the multi-command
;;  help keys (see (@> "Help on Completion Candidates"), above).  That
;;  is, while completing, you can use `C-M-mouse-2', `C-M-RET',
;;  `C-M-next', and so on to describe the command named in the current
;;  completion candidate.
;;
;;(@* "`S-TAB' Is a Multi-Command")
;;  ** `S-TAB' Is a Multi-Command **
;;
;;  Yes, `S-TAB' as `icicle-complete-keys' is a multi-command (see
;;  (@> "Multi-Commands"), above).  This means that you can, within
;;  the same execution of `S-TAB', invoke any number of keys by
;;  clicking (`C-mouse-2') their names in buffer *Completions* or
;;  choosing them any other way (`C-RET', `C-next', and so on).
;;
;;  Since you can navigate up and down the key-binding hierarchy, you
;;  could even stay within a single `S-TAB' invocation to do nearly
;;  everything you want in Emacs (see (@> "Three-Key Emacs"), below)!
;;
;;(@* "Possible Source of Confusion")
;;  ** Possible Source of Confusion **
;;
;;  Keep in mind that `S-TAB' has two different uses in Icicles when
;;  you are providing input in the minibuffer:
;;
;;  * If input completion is available, then `S-TAB' performs apropos
;;    completion (it is, in effect, bound to
;;    `icicle-apropos-complete').
;;
;;  * If input completion is not available, then `S-TAB' performs key
;;    completion (it is, in effect, bound to `icicle-complete-keys').
;;
;;  This is by design; it takes advantage of the fact that these two
;;  contexts are mutually exclusive.  However, this economy comes at a
;;  risk of potential confusion.  It's important that you know whether
;;  or not completion is available when you are inputting text.  If
;;  input completion is not available, but you think it is, then
;;  hitting `S-TAB' might give you a surprise by key completing.  That
;;  behavior is normal - you can use key-completion to input special
;;  characters, for instance.  But if you think that you are instead
;;  completing the original input requested, then you can become
;;  confused.
;;
;;  You can always know whether or not completion is possible when you
;;  are inputting text in the minibuffer, by looking at the start of
;;  the minibuffer prompt.  When input completion is available, the
;;  prompt is prefixed by a highlighted string, by default either ` '
;;  (space) or `=', indicating whether the completion is loose or
;;  must-match, respectively.  The actual strings used, as well as the
;;  highlighting faces used, are the values of
;;  `icicle-completing-prompt-prefix' and
;;  `icicle-completing-mustmatch-prompt-prefix'.
;;
;;  So, when you are inputting, keep an eye out for this highlighting.
;;  If you don't see it when you are prompted for input, it means that
;;  input completion is not available, and it also means that `S-TAB'
;;  is available, not for input completion, but for key completion.
;;  Another clue can be found in the prompt text.  For key completion,
;;  it says "Complete keys: ".
;;
;;  If you nevertheless find this overloaded use of `S-TAB' confusing,
;;  you can change the binding of the key `S-TAB' in
;;  `icicle-mode-map'.  In that case, take a look at the definition of
;;  `icicle-generic-S-tab', which is bound to `S-TAB' in
;;  `icicle-mode-map'.  That generic command "does the right thing",
;;  calling either `icicle-apropos-complete' or
;;  `icicle-complete-keys', depending on whether you are inputting
;;  with or without completion.
;;
;;(@* "Three-Key Emacs")
;;  ** Three-Key Emacs **
;;
;;  Icicles key completion piles a lot of stuff into `S-TAB'.  Just as
;;  `M-x' lets you execute any Emacs command, so does `S-TAB'.  But
;;  `S-TAB' also lets you insert characters.  With the exeception of
;;  inserting multi-byte characters, you might say that it gives you
;;  all of Emacs in one key binding.
;;
;;  Of course, you need a couple other keys, as well.  How many?
;;  Suppose you had limited accessibility in terms of input devices.
;;  Maybe you use Emacs on a cell phone, without voice recognition -
;;  or whatever.  How many keys, buttons, or whatnot do you need to
;;  use Emacs?
;;
;;  1. You need one for `C-g', to interrupt commands.
;;  2. You need one to start telling Emacs what to do.
;;  3. You might need one to choose from a set of possible things to
;;     do.
;;  4. You need one to tell Emacs you're done telling it what to
;;     do.
;;
;;  (#2 and #3 might be combined somehow.)
;;
;;  What does vanilla Emacs offer out of the box in this regard?
;;
;;  * You can get by with just `mouse-1' and the menu-bar menus, but
;;    they don't cover all of Emacs.  You can't use them to enter
;;    text, for instance.  Of course, you could add more menus, to be
;;    able to do more.
;;
;;  * You can use `M-x' plus `RET' to execute any command.  But how
;;    would you insert text?
;;
;;  * Similarly, for `M-:', which lets you evaluate any EmacsLisp
;;    sexp.  You still need a way to type characters.
;;
;;  Icicles key completion lets you do almost anything in Emacs with
;;  three or four keys, buttons, or whatever:
;;
;;  * `S-TAB' - Offers every key sequence as a possible choice to
;;              execute.
;;  * `next'  - Cycles among candidates, for choosing.
;;  * `RET'   - Chooses the current candidate.
;;  * And of course `C-g'.
;;
;;  `S-TAB' includes key `M-x (represented as prefix-key `ESC'
;;  followed by `x'), which offers all commands (even those not bound)
;;  as possible choices.  It also includes key `M-:' (`ESC' followed
;;  by `:'), which lets you execute any Emacs-Lisp expression.  That's
;;  almost all of Emacs!
;;
;;  You could even perhaps get away with only three mouse buttons, and
;;  no keyboard:
;;
;;  * `mouse-1' - Choose candidates, scroll, and so on (direct access,
;;    no cycling).
;;
;;  * `mouse-2' - Do what `S-TAB' does (bind it to
;;    `icicle-complete-keys' and `icicle-apropos-complete').
;;
;;  * `mouse-3' - Do what `C-g' does (bind it to `keyboard-quit' and
;;    `icicle-abort-minibuffer-input').
;;
;;  Here, `mouse-2' and `mouse-3' aren't even used as mouse (pointer)
;;  functions; any keys or buttons would do.  You could use just
;;  `mouse-1' plus a Shift key and a Control key.
;;
;;  Would you want to use Emacs only this way?  Of course not, if you
;;  had a choice.  Typing the character `a' by cycling through every
;;  possible key binding/command combination and hitting `RET' when
;;  you get to `a = self-insert-command' would be the epitome of
;;  tedium.  Likewise, doing everything with a single pointer-device
;;  button.  Using only three or four keys or buttons is definitely
;;  not the ideal way to take advantage of Emacs.
;;
;;  But you are probably not limited to just 3 or 4 keys or buttons.
;;  The real point here is that Icicles `S-TAB' opens the door to
;;  almost everything in Emacs.  And if you do have a normal keyboard,
;;  then you can type letters and such to match command names and key
;;  sequences.  Key `next' matches substrings (regexps, actually),
;;  which makes choice even quicker.
;;
;;  Why only "almost" everything in Emacs?  Because you cannot use
;;  Icicles `S-TAB' to input multi-byte characters (e.g. Chinese,
;;  Japanese, Unicode).  Such characters are grouped in Emacs into
;;  character groups called "generic characters", and it is the
;;  generic characters, not the individual multi-byte characters that
;;  are bound to `self-insert-command'.  Icicles excludes these
;;  special key bindings, because you cannot simply execute
;;  `self-insert-command' to insert these characters.  (It is possible
;;  to implement a completion extension to input such characters, but
;;  that feature has not yet been implemented in Icicles.)
;;
;;  Enjoy!
;;
;;(@* "Entering Special and Foreign Characters")
;;  ** Entering Special and Foreign Characters **
;;
;;  Command `self-insert-command' is bound to each key that is
;;  associated with a character that can be inserted in text.  It is
;;  the binding of the key `a' and the key `$'.  It is also the
;;  binding of keys that your keyboard might not even have - keys that
;;  correspond to special or odd characters and characters in other
;;  languages.
;;
;;  To Icicles key completion, these keys are like any other keys, and
;;  `self-insert-command' is like any other command.  However, because
;;  there are many, many keys bound to it, it can be distracting to
;;  allow such keys as completion candidates.  If option
;;  `icicle-complete-keys-self-insert-flag' is nil (the default
;;  value), then such keys are excluded as candidates.
;;
;;  If it is non-nil, then you can use key completion to insert
;;  characters that your keyboard has no keys for.  This provides a
;;  sort of universal input-method feature that works, in principle,
;;  for all characters (but see below, for exceptions).
;;
;;  To use this feature, just choose a character description (name)
;;  with the mouse or by cycling, if you cannot type its description
;;  (name) with your keyboard.  You can even insert characters this
;;  way that your system has no font for - they will be displayed as
;;  empty boxes, but they will be correctly inserted.
;;
;;  There is an exception, however.  You cannot insert some characters
;;  this way, because they don't have a one-to-one relation with keys
;;  that are bound to `self-insert-command'.  In such cases, "keys"
;;  are bound to `self-insert-command' that represent not single
;;  characters but groups of characters.  Icicles filters out these
;;  keys, so they are not available as completion candidates.  The
;;  problematic keys are in Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Ethiopic,
;;  Indian, Tibetan, and some Unicode character sets.
;;
;;  Because insertion of special characters is useful, but is a
;;  special case of key completion, there is a separate Icicles
;;  command that you can use just for that: `icicle-insert-char'.  It
;;  is a specialized version of `icicle-complete-keys' that uses
;;  `self-insert-command' as the only possible command for completion.
;;
;;(@* "Handling Keymaps That Are Inaccessible From the Global Map")
;;  ** Handling Keymaps That Are Inaccessible From the Global Map **
;;
;;  Actually, `S-TAB' is not bound to `icicle-complete-keys' in every
;;  keymap.  That would be inconvenient, in general.  By default, it
;;  is so bound in each keymap that is accessible from the global
;;  keymap, as determined by function `accessible-keymaps'.
;;
;;  You've seen, above, how you can navigate through prefix keys,
;;  starting with the global map.  In DiredMode, for instance, you can
;;  use `S-TAB' at the top level, then choose the prefix key `*' in
;;  *Completions*, then choose a key, such as `/' (to mark
;;  directories), in the `*' keymap.
;;
;;  However, the act of binding of `S-TAB' in keymaps that are
;;  accessible from the global map does not bind it in the `*' prefix
;;  keymap itself.  To handle this case, Icicles explicitly does for
;;  `dired-mode-map' what it does for the global map: it binds `S-TAB'
;;  in each (non-menu) keymap that is accessible from
;;  `dired-mode-map'.  (Menu maps are always skipped.)  Because of
;;  this, you can use `* S-TAB' to show all key completions of `*'.
;;
;;  This treatment of `dired-mode-map' is done by default.  But you
;;  might have other keymaps that you would like to treat similarly -
;;  keymaps that Icicles might be unaware of.  You do this by
;;  including them in the list value of user option
;;  `icicle-keymaps-for-key-completion'.  The list entries are
;;  Emacs-Lisp symbols that are bound to keymaps, each of which should
;;  define at least one prefix key.  If you add a keymap variable to
;;  this list, then `S-TAB' will be bound so that you can use it to
;;  complete the prefix keys defined by that map.
;;
;;  Notice that there is no keymap variable that corresponds to prefix
;;  key `*' in Dired mode.  You need only provide a keymap (variable
;;  `dired-mode-map') from which the prefix key is accessible; it is
;;  not necessary to also provide a variable that corresponds to the
;;  prefix keymap itself.
;;
;;  If a keymap listed in `icicle-keymaps-for-key-completion' is not
;;  defined when Icicle mode is entered, then it is ignored.  If you
;;  later define that keymap, then just exit and reenter Icicle mode
;;  for the `S-TAB' binding to take effect.  For example, use `M-x
;;  icy-mode' twice after entering Calendar mode, to be able to
;;  complete `calendar-mode' prefix keys such as `t' - `t S-TAB'.
 
;;(@* "Icicles Multi `M-x'")
;;
;;  Icicles Multi `M-x'
;;  -------------------
;;
;;  How about a multi-command replacement for `M-x'?  Instead of
;;  executing a single command, it would execute any number of
;;  commands.
;;
;;  When you use `M-x' in vanilla Emacs, you are actually executing
;;  the standard Emacs command `execute-extended-command'.  That
;;  command prompts you for the name of another command, which you
;;  input.  It uses `completing-read' to do this, which is why you can
;;  take advantage of Icicles features when you use `M-x'.  Nothing
;;  new here.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-execute-extended-command' is simply a
;;  multi-command version of `execute-extended-command'.  It does the
;;  same thing, except that it also lets you execute multiple
;;  commands, one by one, using `C-RET' (or `C-next'), without ever
;;  exiting the minibuffer.
;;
;;  If option `icicle-bind-top-level-commands-flag' is non-`nil', then
;;  `M-x' is bound to `icicle-execute-extended-command' whenever you
;;  are in Icicle mode.  If you never use it as a multi-command, you
;;  won't notice any difference from `execute-extended-command'.
;;
;;(@* "Examples of Using Multi `M-x'")
;;  ** Examples of Using Multi `M-x' **
;;
;;  Example: Repeat a command multiple times.  Yes, `C-x z' does this
;;  already (and better) - this is just an illustration.  `M-x
;;  forward-ch TAB' completes to `forward-char'.  Then, use `C-RET' to
;;  execute that command.  Repeat as many times as you want.  Use a
;;  prefix arg if you like.
;;
;;  To switch to another command in the same `M-x' invocation: Erase
;;  the minibuffer (`M-k'), complete the second command, then use
;;  `C-RET'.  As long as you haven't yet used `RET', `S-RET', `C-g'
;;  (or, say, `C-]'), you remain within the same invocation of `M-x'.
;;
;;  What about executing a command that, itself, reads an input
;;  argument?  That's OK.  And if that command reads its input with
;;  completion, then you can use `C-RET' on the completion candidates
;;  for that input.
;;
;;  Example: `M-x describe-var TAB C-RET' gives you the prompt for
;;  command `describe-variable'.
;;
;;  1. You type `ici.*flag S-TAB' to see the available Boolean Icicles
;;     options.
;;
;;  2. You hit `next' until variable `icicle-cycle-into-subdirs-flag'
;;     is highlighted.
;;
;;  3. You hit `C-RET' to display its documentation.
;;
;;  4. You type `C-next' a few times to see the doc of other Icicles
;;     toggle options.
;;
;;  5. You use `M-k' to erase the minibuffer, then type `column S-TAB'
;;     to see variables about columns.
;;
;;  6. You cycle through them with `next', then use `C-RET' on
;;     `fill-column' to show its documentation.
;;
;;  7. You use `C-next' to do the same for `goal-column'.
;;
;;  8. You use `RET' to finish with command `describe-variable' - but
;;     you're still in the same invocation of `M-x'.
;;
;;  9. You change the input to `describe-function' and play again,
;;     this time with function names...
;;
;;  Remember, if you get confused or lost: `C-]'
;;  (`abort-recursive-edit') or `M-x top-level' will always straighten
;;  you out.

;;(@* "Multi `M-x' Turns Every Command into a Multi-Command")
;;  ** Multi `M-x' Turns Every Command into a Multi-Command **
;;
;;  Most of the time, of course, you do not execute commands
;;  successively by name; instead, you use key bindings.  The point
;;  here is that even if you have a binding for a command, Icicles
;;  `M-x' lets you use any command as a multi-command, which can
;;  sometimes be advantageous.
;;
;;  For example, Icicles defines and binds a real multi-command to
;;  `C-x 0' in Icicle mode, which lets you delete any number of
;;  windows.  But, even without such a multi-command, you can get a
;;  similar effect by using `M-x delete-windows-on'.  In this way, you
;;  can turn ordinary Emacs commands that use completion into
;;  multi-commands.
;;
;;  The other point is that you can move from one command to another
;;  within the same execution of `M-x'.  This is a different feature
;;  from being able to use any command that uses completion as a

;;(@* "Choose All Completion Candidates")
;;
;;  Choose All Completion Candidates
;;  --------------------------------
;;
;;  The previous section describes how you can use `C-RET'
;;  (`icicle-candidate-action') to choose (act on) multiple completion
;;  candidates, individually.  If you hold down the Control key while
;;  you cycle through the candidates, you can run through each of
;;  them, one by one.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-all-candidates-action', which is bound to `C-!' in
;;  the minibuffer, is just a shorthand way of doing that: act on all
;;  candidates that match the current input.  `C-!' reports on any
;;  objects that were not acted upon successfully (in buffer *Help*).
;;
;;  All multi-commands let you use `C-!' in this way.  Whenever a
;;  command defines a special action for `C-RET' to perform on the
;;  current completion candidate, you can use `C-!' to perform it on
;;  all candidates at once.
;;
;;  Perhaps you already use `% m' (command `dired-mark-files-regexp')
;;  in Dired to mark all files that match a given regular expression,
;;  and then operate on all of the marked files in some way (search
;;  with `A', query-replace with `Q', open with `F', delete with `D',
;;  and so on).  When you execute a multi-command, `C-!' lets you do
;;  something similar.  It applies `icicle-candidate-action-fn' to
;;  each completion that matches (apropos or prefix) the current input
;;  in the minibuffer.
;;
;;  Most top-level Icicles commands are multi-commands.  Command
;;  `icicle-delete-file' is an example.  Instead of entering a file
;;  name at the prompt (e.g. using completion or cycling), you can
;;  type a regular expression, use `S-TAB' to see all matching files,
;;  and then use `C-!' to delete all of them at once.
;;
;;  You get the idea: Use the minibuffer to determine a set of objects
;;  by pattern matching, and then act on all elements of the set.
 
;;(@* "Sets of Completion Candidates")
;;
;;  Sets of Completion Candidates
;;  -----------------------------
;;
;;  Whereas `C-RET' acts on individual objects, `C-!'  acts on an
;;  entire set of objects at once, via their names: the set of all
;;  current completion candidates.  There are additional Icicles
;;  commands that act, not on individual completion candidates, but on
;;  one or more sets of completion candidates.
;;
;;  One of these is `M-*', which effectively narrows the set of
;;  completion candidates by taking the intersection of the candidate
;;  sets defined by various input regexps.
;;
;;  This section presents some more Icicles commands that act on sets
;;  of completion candidates.  The basic idea is that you can perform
;;  set operations using the current set of completion candidates,
;;  changing it into a different set.  The available set-operation
;;  commands presented here are these:
;;
;;  * `icicle-candidate-set-save', bound to `C-M->'.  Save the current
;;    set of completion candidates, for use in a subsequent set
;;    operation (see below).  The saved set is not persistent; it is
;;    saved only until the next `C-M->' in the same Emacs session.
;;
;;  * `icicle-candidate-set-retrieve', bound to `C-M-<'.  Retrieve the
;;    saved set of completion candidates, making it the current set.
;;
;;  * `icicle-candidate-set-swap', bound to `C-%'.  Swap the saved and
;;    current sets of completion candidates.
;;
;;  * `icicle-candidate-set-define', bound to `C-:'.  Define the
;;    current set of completion candidates by evaluating an input
;;    sexpr.  The sexpr must evaluate to a list of strings, such as is
;;    returned by `all-completions'.  You can use this to substitute
;;    any list of strings, and then operate on them as completions,
;;    using any Icicles functionalities.  Keep in mind, however, that
;;    the completions must be of the proper type for the context in
;;    which they are used.  For example, if you are executing a
;;    command, they must be command names.
;;
;;  * `icicle-candidate-set-complement', bound to `C-~'.  Complement
;;    the current set of candidates: replace the current candidate set
;;    with its set complement.  This means all possible completions of
;;    the appropriate type that do *not* match the current input.  You
;;    can combine this with progressive completion (`M-*') to
;;    progressively eliminate candidates that match different inputs.
;;    This process-of-elimination matching is a common Icicles usage
;;    idiom.
;;
;;  * `icicle-candidate-set-union', bound to `C-+'.  Replace the
;;    current candidate set by its union with the saved set of
;;    candidates.
;;
;;  * `icicle-candidate-set-difference', bound to `C--'.  Replace the
;;    current candidate set by its set difference with the saved set
;;    of candidates.  That is, the saved candidates are subtracted
;;    from the current candidates, and the result becomes the current
;;    candidate set.  To obtain the opposite set difference,
;;    subtracting the current candidates from the saved candidates,
;;    just use `icicle-candidate-set-swap' followed by
;;    `icicle-candidate-set-difference'.
;;
;;  * `icicle-candidate-set-intersection', bound to `C-*'.  Replace
;;    the current candidate set by its intersection with the saved set
;;    of candidates.  Unlike the set intersection provided by `M-*',
;;    `C-*' is, in itself, a one-time operation.  `M-*' can be
;;    repeated, using the previous intersection as one of the sets to
;;    be intersected in a new operation.  Both `C-*' and `M-*' use the
;;    current set of matching candidates as one of the sets being
;;    intersected.  But `M-*' reads another input regexp to define the
;;    other set to be intersected, whereas `C-*' uses the saved
;;    candidates set as the other set.  `M-*' is useful for chaining,
;;    to achieve progressive approximation.  `C-*' is useful to
;;    perform an intersection on a set from a previous input reading.
;;
;;  * `icicle-candidate-set-truncate', bound to `M-$'.  Truncate the
;;    set of completion candidates, so that it includes only the first
;;    N candidates (as displayed in *Completions*).  You are prompted
;;    for N.  You can use this when the order of candidates represents
;;    priority in some way, so that you are interested only in the
;;    topmost candidates.
;;
;;  You can operate on or choose from all input values in the set
;;  resulting from any of these set operations.  For example, you can
;;  use `C-~' to see the list of objects that do not match the current
;;  input, to cycle among those objects, or to operate on any or all
;;  of them.  Use `C-~' at any time to switch to the complement of the
;;  current set of candidates.
;;
;;  Example: To cycle through all files whose names do not end in
;;           `el', you can do the following:
;;
;;  1. Use `C-f' to read a file name.
;;  2. Type `el$' to match all file names that end in `el'.
;;  3. Use `S-TAB' to show the matching files.
;;  4. Use `C-~' to flip to the complement: files not ending in `el'.
;;  5. Use `next' or `prior' to cycle among the new set of candidates.
;;
;;  A minibuffer message briefly confirms each of the set operations.
;;
;;  When buffer *Completions* is displayed, the union, difference, and
;;  intersection commands scroll the buffer when repeated, just like
;;  `TAB' and `S-TAB' do.  Repeating `icicle-candidate-set-complement'
;;  complements the complement, of course, giving the original set.
;;
;;  Once you have established a set of completion candidates using any
;;  of the candidate-set commands, you can cycle among the candidates
;;  of that set using either prefix or apropos cycling (that is,
;;  `next'/`prior' or `down'/`up').  However, switching from prefix to
;;  apropos cycling (or completion), or vice versa, establishes a new
;;  completion set of the appropriate type, as usual.  Switching
;;  completion type signifies that you are finished with the specially
;;  defined completion set, and you want to redefine it using apropos
;;  or prefix cycling or completion.
;;
;;  When you save a set of completion candidates, it is saved in
;;  variable `icicle-saved-completion-candidates', by default.  You
;;  can process this list of names in any way you like using Emacs
;;  Lisp.  For example, you can save a list of file names that match a
;;  regexp, then print the list or process the individual files in
;;  some way.  Here, for instance, is how to save the set of file
;;  names that contain either `dir' or `ici':
;;
;;    `C-x C-f \(dir\|ici\) S-TAB C-M-> C-g'
;;
;;  You can save the current set of completions to a different
;;  variable from `icicle-saved-completion-candidates' by using a
;;  numeric prefix argument to command `icicle-candidate-set-save';
;;  that is, use `C-u N C-M->'.  Alternatively, use `C-M-}', which is
;;  bound to command `icicle-candidate-set-save-to-variable'.  You are
;;  prompted for the name of the variable, and you can use completion
;;  when inputting it.  Such variables are in a special namespace, so
;;  they are the only candidates for this completion.
;;
;;  To retrieve completion candidates that were previously saved to a
;;  variable other than `icicle-saved-completion-candidates', so that
;;  they become the current set of candidates, use either `C-u N
;;  C-M-<', where N is an integer, or `C-M-{'
;;  (`icicle-candidate-set-retrieve' or
;;  `icicle-candidate-set-retrieve-from-variable').
;;
;;  Note that using a plain prefix argument (`C-u' without a number)
;;  with `C-M->' and `C-M-<' saves or retrieves a
;;  completion-candidates set using a cache file, not a variable.  See
;;  (@> "Persistent Sets of Completion Candidates"), below.
;;
;;  You can use Icicles commands `icicle-dired-saved-file-candidates'
;;  and `icicle-dired-saved-file-candidates-other-window' to open
;;  Dired on a saved list of file names - only those files are listed
;;  in the Dired buffer.
;;
;;  Note: Prefix icompletion (`icomplete.el' or `icomplete+.el' - see
;;        (@> "Icompletion"), above) does not take into account the
;;        candidate set resulting from a set operation: it always
;;        displays the normal set of prefix completions in the
;;        minibuffer.
;;
;;  You might have noticed that, as a mnemonic device, the keys bound
;;  to the various set operations use the corresponding binary
;;  arithmetic or Boolean operators: `~' (unary negation) for
;;  complement (not); `*' (multiplication) for intersection (and); `+'
;;  (addition) for union (or); and `-' (subtraction) for difference.

;;  Google Matching
;;  ---------------
;;
;;  This section presents nothing new - but you might not want to skip
;;  it.  It points out something that you might not have picked up
;;  yet.  You've learned about Icicles regexp matching and candidate
;;  set operations, but it can be worthwhile to compare how Icicles
;;  matches inputs against completion candidates with how Google
;;  matches search strings against Web pages.  Summary: You can do
;;  pretty much the same things, but the way you accomplish them is
;;  different.
;;
;;(@* "Domain of Discourse")
;;  ** Domain of Discourse **
;;
;;  In Google, the domain of discourse, that is, the possible set of
;;  search hits, is the set of Web pages.  There are also search
;;  fields that limit the domain of discourse by file type, page
;;  number, update date, page position, freedom of use, and even
;;  morality ("Safe Search").
;;
;;  In Icicles (Emacs), the domain of discourse changes automatically,
;;  depending on the current context.  For command-name input, it is
;;  the set of all named commands; for variable-name input, it is the
;;  set of variable names; and so on.
;;
;;(@* "Global Filtering")
;;  ** Global Filtering **
;;
;;  In Google, you can limit searching to specific Web sites, or
;;  exclude certain Web sites from searching.
;;
;;  In Icicles, you can add extra completion candidates, using
;;  variable `icicle-extra-candidates', and you can filter out
;;  candidates, globally, using filter variables
;;  `icicle-must-match-regexp', `icicle-must-not-match-regexp', and
;;  `icicle-must-pass-predicate'.  You don't normally change such
;;  variables interactively, however; instead, a command can use them
;;  to limit or extend the effective domain of discourse.
;;  See (@> "Global Filters"), below.
;;
;;(@* "Word Matching and String Matching")
;;  ** Word Matching and String Matching **
;;
;;  Google matches words, by default, but you can specify an "exact
;;  phrase" to get literal string matching.
;;
;;  By default, Icicles (apropos-)matches regexps, but you can use
;;  `\b' in a regexp to perform word matching, and you can use `C-`'
;;  (`icicle-toggle-regexp-quote') to perform exact (literal)
;;  matching.  See (@> "What About Special-Character Conflicts?"),
;;  above.
;;
;;(@* "AND Matching and OR Matching")
;;  ** AND Matching and OR Matching **
;;
;;  Google has search fields for AND matching ("with all of the
;;  words") and OR matching ("with at least one of the words").
;;
;;  In Icicles, you can use progressive completion to perform AND
;;  matching: use `M-*' to introduce each term to match.
;;  Alternatively, you can use `C-*'
;;  (`icicle-candidate-set-intersection').  You can use `C-+'
;;  (`icicle-candidate-set-union') to perform OR matching.  See
;;  (@> "Progressive Completion") and
;;  (@> "Sets of Completion Candidates"), above.
;;
;;(@* "NOT Matching")
;;  ** NOT Matching **
;;
;;  Google has a search field for terms that must not occur in search
;;  hits: "without the words".
;;
;;  In Icicles, you can use `C-~' (`icicle-candidate-set-complement')
;;  to exclude matching completion candidates.  You can combine this
;;  with progressive completion, to exclude any number of terms: `toto
;;  C-~ M-* titi C-~ M-* foobar' excludes all candidates matching
;;  toto, titi, or foobar.  Use this process-of-eliminiation technique
;;  to progressively pare down the set of possible candidates.  See
;;  (@> "Sets of Completion Candidates") and
;;  (@> "Progressive Completion"), above.
 
;;(@* "File-Name Input and Locating Files Anywhere")
;;
;;  File-Name Input and Locating Files Anywhere
;;  -------------------------------------------
;;
;;  Most Icicles commands that target file or directory names make use
;;  of function `read-file-name' to read the file name with
;;  completion.  This includes all Icicles commands defined with
;;  `icicle-define-file-command'.  An example is multi-command
;;  `icicle-find-file', which visits one or more files.
;;
;;  When `read-file-name' is used to read input, only the file name
;;  itself, not the directory portion, is used for matching.  The
;;  behavior is thus the same whether or not the directory is present
;;  in the minibuffer.  If you prefer, you can delete the directory
;;  first, using `M-k' (the `default-directory' is used, by default).
;;
;;  This means, in particular, that you can use apropos completion to
;;  match a substring, without needing to prefix the substring with
;;  `.*' in the minibuffer.  For example, to match the file named
;;  `favorite-foo-file.bar' in directory `/some/path/to/my/', you need
;;  not use `/some/path/to/my/.*foo'; it is sufficient to use either
;;  `foo' or `/some/path/to/my/foo'.
;;
;;  It is possible, however, for a command to target file names but
;;  make use of `completing-read' instead of `read-file-name'.  In
;;  that case, there is, a priori, no notion of `default-directory';
;;  the completion candidates are treated simply as strings.  Since
;;  `completing-read' has no notion of file names, it is also the case
;;  that file-name wildcards such as `*' are not taken into account by
;;  it.  Unless the command that calls `completing-read' does
;;  something special to interpret such wildcards, you cannot use them
;;  in input strings.  (You can of course use `*' in regexps - see
;;  (@> "What About Special-Character Conflicts?"), above, for the
;;  distinction.)
;;
;;  Examples of Icicles multi-commands that read a file name using
;;  `completing-read', not `read-file-name', are `icicle-locate-file',
;;  `icicle-locate-file-other-window', `icicle-recent-file', and
;;  `icicle-recent-file-other-window'.  The advantage of using
;;  `completing-read' is the flip side of the main disadvantage: There
;;  is no notion of `default-directory'.  This means that these
;;  commands let you regexp-match against any part of the absolute
;;  file name, including directory components.  This makes sense for
;;  these commands, because the set of completion candidates can
;;  include absolute file names from many different directories.
;;
;;  Commands `icicle-recent-file' and
;;  `icicle-recent-file-other-window' let you open any file that you
;;  have visited recently, perhaps in a previous Emacs session.
;;  Commands `icicle-locate-file' and
;;  `icicle-locate-file-other-window' can be used to find a file when
;;  you do not know what directory it is in.  They look throughout a
;;  given directory, including throughout all of its subdirectories.
;;
;;  By default, the target directory is the current directory, but if
;;  you supply a prefix argument then you are prompted for the
;;  directory to search.  If you use the root of your file system as
;;  the search directory, then the locate-file commands will match
;;  completion candidates anywhere in your file system.
;;
;;  This can be quite useful.  It gives you much of the power of the
;;  Unix `find' command just for completing input!  And with
;;  incremental completion (see (@> "Icompletion"), above), you can
;;  see what matches your input as you type.
;;
;;  Obviously, if you use your entire file system as the set of
;;  completion candidates then gathering and matching such a large set
;;  of file names can take some time.  On my hard drive, for instance,
;;  there are 36 GB full of files, and it takes about 40 seconds to
;;  gather all of the file names.  In spite of this inconvenience,
;;  this functionality can be useful.  And of course searching a
;;  shallower directory tree presents less of a performance penalty -
;;  you pay for what you get.
;;
;;  There is a way, however, of having your cake and eating it too.
;;  You can gather all of the file names in your file system once, and
;;  save that list of completion candidates to a cache file on disk,
;;  as a snapshot.
;;  See (@> "Persistent Sets of Completion Candidates"), below, for
;;  more on this.
;;
;;  See Also: (@> "Dealing With Large Candidate Sets"), below.
 
;;(@* "Persistent Sets of Completion Candidates")
;;
;;  Persistent Sets of Completion Candidates
;;  ----------------------------------------
;;
;;  Section "Sets of Completion Candidates", above, describes how you
;;  can save the current set of completion candidates and reuse it
;;  later.  This is not a persistent save, however; the candidates are
;;  simply saved in variable `icicle-saved-completion-candidates' for
;;  the duration of your Emacs session (or until you save candidates
;;  again).
;;
;;  You can save the current set of completions (whatever it is)
;;  persistently by supplying a plain prefix argument (`C-u') when you
;;  use `C-M->' (`icicle-candidate-set-save').  Alternatively, you can
;;  use `C-}', bound to `icicle-candidate-set-save-to-cache-file',
;;  which does the same thing.  To retrieve completion candidates that
;;  were previously saved to a cache file, so that they become the
;;  current set of candidates, use either `C-u C-M-<' or `C-{'
;;  (`icicle-candidate-set-retrieve' or
;;  `icicle-candidate-set-retrieve-from-cache-file').
;;
;;  Note that using a numeric prefix argument (`C-u' with a number)
;;  with `C-M->' and `C-M-<' saves or retrieves a
;;  completion-candidates set using a variable that you name, not a
;;  cache file.  See (@> "Sets of Completion Candidates"), above.
;;
;;  If you have used the Emacs file-name cache (see the Emacs manual,
;;  node "File Name Cache"), then you have already used a cache file
;;  of (file-name) completion candidates.  In vanilla Emacs, you use
;;  `C-TAB' during file-name input to complete to a cached file name.
;;  In Icicles, you use `C-{'.
;;
;;  In Icicles, the cached candidates are not limited to file names,
;;  and you can have any number of cache files, to save different sets
;;  of completion candidates.  Each cache file saves the set of
;;  candidates that was current when you created (saved) the set.
;;
;;  The fact that a cache file can contain just those candidates that
;;  were current when you saved it is a considerable advantage, when
;;  combined with Icicles features for sculpting the current set of
;;  matching candidates.  As far as I know, Icicles is the only
;;  package to offer this feature.  You spend a few moments to
;;  fine-tune a set of candidates, using, for example, `M-*', `C-~',
;;  and `delete', and then save it for later use.  From then on, you
;;  can match against exactly those candidates anytime you want.
;;
;;  For example, you might have a software project that involves only
;;  certain directories and perhaps only certain kinds of files in
;;  those directories are of interest as completion candidates.  Those
;;  directories and files can even be in disparate locations.  Start
;;  with command `icicle-locate-file'.  Then use progressive
;;  completion to match the directories and files you want and chip
;;  away at those you don't want.  Once you get just the set you need
;;  for your project, save that set using `C-}'.  You can have any
;;  number of saved sets, for different projects or different purposes
;;  in the same project.
;;
;;  You name the sets of saved candidates, and these names are
;;  associated with the cache files in user option
;;  `icicle-saved-completion-sets'.  This is an alist of entries, each
;;  of which is of the form (SET-NAME . CACHE-FILE-NAME).  You can
;;  customize this option, or set it in your init file (~/.emacs).
;;
;;  You can use command `icicle-add/update-saved-completion-set' to
;;  add a new set to `icicle-saved-completion-sets' or update
;;  (replace) an existing such set.  You can use command
;;  `icicle-remove-saved-completion-set' to remove a saved set.
;;
;;  As an alternative to customizing `icicle-saved-completion-sets' or
;;  using command `icicle-add/update-saved-completion-set', you can
;;  simply try to save a set of completion candidates persistently,
;;  using `C-u C-M->' or `C-}'.  You are then prompted for the names
;;  of the candidate set and cache file to use, and the names you
;;  enter are automatically entered in option
;;  `icicle-saved-completion-sets'.  That option is automatically
;;  saved to your custom file, so the next time you use Emacs you can
;;  retrieve any saved set of candidates that you like.
;;
;;  When you try to retrieve a persistent set of completion
;;  candidates, you are similarly prompted for the candidate-set name
;;  and the cache-file name.
;;
;;  In addition to saving the current set of completion candidates to
;;  a cache file, you can add individual strings as future completion
;;  candidates to any cache file, and you can remove candidates from a
;;  cache file individually.  You do this using commands
;;  `icicle-add-candidate-to-saved-completion-set' and
;;  `icicle-remove-candidate-from-saved-completion-set'.
;;
;;  Adding an individual candidate is similar to using the Emacs
;;  file-name cache commands that add file names to the cache, but it
;;  adds only a single candidate.  For file names, adding a directory
;;  name effectively provides completion for all of its files as well,
;;  so there is no need to add each file name as well as the directory
;;  name.  Alternatively, you can always use `C-}' to add all file
;;  names that match your current input.
;;
;;  "File-Name Input and Locating Files Anywhere", above, tells you
;;  how you can locate any file in your file system.  If you save the
;;  set of all file names persistently, you will increase the
;;  performance of using it - it is much faster to retrieve the list
;;  of all file names than it is to generate it.
;;
;;  With 36 GB of files in my file system, my all-file-system cache
;;  file is 20 MB, and retrieving the file-name completions from it
;;  takes only a few seconds.  With this feature, Icicles essentially
;;  gives you the functionality of the Unix `locate' command, but with
;;  the addition of real-time regexp matching.  Here is all you do:
;;
;;    M-x icicle-locate-file RET
;;    C-#        ; Once or twice: turn off incremental completion.
;;    C-{        ; Retrieve all file names from your cache file.
;;               ; You are prompted for the set name and file name.
;;    foo.*bar   ; Regexp to match names with `foo' followed by `bar'.
;;    S-TAB      ; Update *Completions* display (because of `C-#').
;;
;;  Of course, once you have retrieved a set of candidates from your
;;  cache file, you can access them again without re-reading the file.
;;  When they are retrieved from your cache they are saved in variable
;;  `icicle-saved-completion-candidates', so the next time you want to
;;  use them, just retrieve them from this variable with `C-M-<'.

;;
;;  Dealing With Large Candidate Sets
;;  ---------------------------------
;;
;;  One of the advantages Icicles provides is the ability to deal with
;;  large sets of completion candidates with ease.  There are other
;;  libraries that also let you cycle among various choices of
;;  different kinds (buffers, files, and so on), but cycling quickly
;;  loses its effectiveness as the number of candidates increases.
;;
;;  Icicles apropos matching lets you work with a large initial set of
;;  candidates by filtering them, quickly reducing the number
;;  candidates to cycle through.  Filtering by a prefix only (vanilla
;;  Emacs) is not very potent.  Until you get used to Icicles, you
;;  will be surprised at your ability to manipulate even humongous
;;  sets of choices.
;;
;;  Nevertheless, there can be times when a candidate set is so large
;;  that you need to use a few tricks to deal with it efficiently.
;;  There are two main things that take time when dealing with a large
;;  set: computing the set and displaying it (with highlighting) in
;;  buffer *Completions*.  In particular, incremental completion
;;  display is costly because it does both of these, recompute the set
;;  and redisplay it, each time you type or delete a character in the
;;  minibuffer.
;;
;;  Here are some tips to improve performance with a large set of
;;  candidates:
;;
;;  * Turn off incremental completion display in buffer *Completions*.
;;    You can do this on the fly at any time by using `C-#' in the
;;    minibuffer - use `C-#' again to turn it back on.  See
;;    (@> "Icompletion"), above.
;;
;;  * Compute a large candidate set only once, cache the result, and
;;    reuse it later by reading the cache instead of recomputing.
;;    This is useful, for instance, for the candidate set of all files
;;    on your file system.  You can cache a set of candidates in
;;    either a variable (quickest, but not persistent) or a disk file
;;    (slower, persistent).
;;    See (@> "Persistent Sets of Completion Candidates"), above.
;;
;;  * Compute a large candidate set (and perhaps cache it or filter
;;    it) without displaying it in *Completions*, by using `C-M-TAB'
;;    or `S-C-M-TAB' instead of `TAB' or `S-TAB', respectively.  These
;;    are bound to commands `icicle-prefix-complete-no-display' and
;;    `icicle-apropos-complete-no-display'.  For example, when
;;    initially computing the set of all files on your file system for
;;    `M-x C-u icicle-locate-file', use `S-C-M-TAB' to compute the
;;    set, then use `C-}' to save it to a cache file - you need never
;;    display it.
 
;;(@* "History Enhancements")
;;
;;  History Enhancements
;;  --------------------
;;
;;  Icicles enhances minibuffer history in four independent ways:
;;
;;  1. Candidates displayed in *Completions* are highlighted using
;;     face `icicle-historical-candidate' (blue foreground, by
;;     default), when they have been used previously, so you can more
;;     easily recognize them.  This highlighting is controlled by
;;     option `icicle-highlight-historical-candidates-flag'.  You can
;;     toggle this from the minibuffer at any time using `C-pause'.
;;
;;  2. Command `icicle-toggle-alternative-sorting', (`C-M-,' in the
;;     minibuffer) re-sorts completion candidates, placing previously
;;     used candidates first.  This is a toggle: repeat it to return
;;     to the original order.
;;
;;  3. Command `icicle-keep-only-past-inputs' (`M-pause' in the
;;     minibuffer) restricts the current set of completion candidates
;;     to those that you have used previously.  In other words, it
;;     keeps only those candidates that are highlighted in blue.  To
;;     use `M-pause', you must first have used `TAB' or `S-TAB' to
;;     establish an explicit candidate set.  If you use `C-u M-pause',
;;     then the previously used candidates are ordered
;;     chronologically, most recent first.  Without `C-u', the normal
;;     sort order is used (`icicle-sort-function').
;;
;;  4. Command `icicle-history' (`M-h' in the minibuffer) matches the
;;     current input against the minibuffer history directly.
;;
;;  Each of these enhancements lets you see the complete list of
;;  previous inputs that match your current input.  In vanilla Emacs,
;;  the history lists are never shown as such; you can access previous
;;  inputs only one at a time, in order (with `M-p').  In vanilla
;;  Emacs, you can use a regexp to search the history list (via
;;  `M-r'), but the regexp matching is not dynamic, and the first
;;  match found is the (only) one you get.
;;
;;  Displaying previous inputs that match the current input sounds
;;  like a minor advantage, but it is actually quite helpful in
;;  practice.  Among other things, it means that you can work with
;;  long history lists in a practical way.
;;
;;(@* "Putting Previous Candidates First: `C-M-,'")
;;  ** Putting Previous Candidates First: `C-M-,' **
;;
;;  At any time, Icicles has two different sort orders that you can
;;  use (and customize).  These are the values of user options
;;  `icicle-sort-function' and `icicle-alternative-sort-function'.  By
;;  default, the former sorts alphabetically, and the latter puts all
;;  previously used inputs first, before the candidates you have not
;;  yet used.  Each of these groups, used and unused candidates, is
;;  then sorted alphabetically, separately.  So, with the default
;;  alternative sort, you can see all matching candidates (used and
;;  unused), but you privilege those used previously - they are the
;;  first listed in *Completions* and the first available for cycling.
;;
;;  If you prefer, by customizing these user options, you can use
;;  `icicle-historical-alphabetic-p' as the main sort function (option
;;  `icicle-sort-function') and some other sort function
;;  (e.g. `icicle-case-string-less-p') as the alternative sort
;;  function.
;;
;;  You can toggle at any time between normal sorting and alternative
;;  sorting, using command `icicle-toggle-alternative-sorting'.
;;  During completion, this is bound to `C-M-,'.  Together with
;;  toggling between normal sorting and not sorting at all, which is a
;;  sort-order choice available through `C-,', this gives you quite a
;;  lot of flexibility.  Some commands, such as `icicle-complete-keys'
;;  (bound to `S-TAB' except during completion), use different sort
;;  orders.
;;
;;(@* "Matching Only Historical Candidates: `M-h' and `M-pause'")
;;  ** Matching Only Historical Candidates: `M-h' and `M-pause' **
;;
;;  Both `M-h' and `M-pause' can be used toward the same end.  They
;;  both work for all input types.  They both use the appropriate
;;  history list for the current command.  They both provide apropos
;;  completion and cycling for the minibuffer history (as well as
;;  prefix completion, of course).  Use them as another way to search
;;  through a history list or complete to one of its elements.
;;
;;  For example, If you use `C-x C-f' to find a file, and then use
;;  `M-h' or `M-pause', the completion candidates will be the names of
;;  files that you have previously accessed (file names you have input
;;  in the minibuffer), and which match the current minibuffer input.
;;
;;  `M-h' lets you complete your input against the minibuffer input
;;  history.  `M-pause' lets you restrict the current explicit set of
;;  completion candidates to those that are also in the minibuffer
;;  history.
;;
;;  They provide similar functionality in different ways.  The
;;  difference is that `M-pause' takes the current set of matching
;;  candidates into account.  It is a completion-candidates set
;;  operation, similar to those described in "Sets of Completion
;;  Candidates", above.
;;
;;  This means, in particular, that with `M-pause' you can first
;;  perform set operations on the set of candidates, and then use that
;;  result to restrict the history search.  For example, you can first
;;  complement the candidate set using `C-~', then use `M-pause' to
;;  restrict those candidates to matches in the history list.  In this
;;  way, you avoid including matches from the original match set when
;;  searching the history.
;;
;;  Example: You are in a directory with lots of files that have the
;;  prefix `foo' and lots of C-language source files.  You happen to
;;  be interested in another file, however.  One way to get to that
;;  file is to use Dired's ability to mark files by matching a regexp
;;  and then use Dired's ability to omit the marked files from view.
;;  You can scan through those that remain, and pick the one you want.
;;  However, it turns out that even then there are many files to scan.
;;  You accessed the one you want now just the other day, but the file
;;  date is unfortunately not significant.
;;
;;  In Icicles, you use regexp matching and take the set complement of
;;  the hits, just like in Dired: `C-x C-f foo.*\.c$' defines the
;;  candidate set as all files whose names start with `foo' and have
;;  extension `c'.  `C-~' then defines the candidate set as all files
;;  whose names are not like that.  Finally, you use `M-pause' to
;;  restrict the file-name candidates to names that you have used
;;  before.  You've accessed many, many files recently, so just
;;  cycling through the history with `M-p' would be tedious.  You
;;  could match a regexp against the file history, but how can you
;;  come up with a regexp that finds anti-matches?
;;
;;  A consequence of this difference between `M-h' and `M-pause' is
;;  that using `TAB' or `S-TAB' after `M-pause' abandons use of the
;;  minibuffer history and starts a new set of completion candidates.
;;  It simply completes the current input in the context of the
;;  current command; `TAB' and `S-TAB' have nothing to do with the
;;  minibuffer history in this case.  Using `TAB' or `S-TAB' after
;;  `M-h', however, re-completes your input against the current
;;  history list.
;;
;;  Another consequence is that you can use `down' or `C-down' on the
;;  candidates displayed by `M-h', but not on those displayed by
;;  `M-pause'.  For example, to cycle through the doc for each
;;  variable that starts with `icicle-' which you have previously
;;  input, you can use `C-h v icicle- M-h', then repeatedly use
;;  `C-down'.
;;
;;  Also, file-name and directory-name completion works differently in
;;  these two commands.  By default, the current directory is (as
;;  always) inserted into the minibuffer by commands such as
;;  `find-file', so either `M-h' or `M-pause' after `C-x C-f' will
;;  match previously input file names from the current directory.
;;
;;  However, in the case of `M-h', the entire minibuffer input is
;;  matched against the history list, which is a list of absolute file
;;  names.  `M-pause' works only with the current candidate set,
;;  which, if you have already used `TAB' or `S-TAB' in the current
;;  directory, is a set of relative file names in that directory.
;;
;;  This difference has a consequence for apropos (regexp) completion
;;  with `M-h'.  It means that to match a file name using a substring
;;  you must, in the minibuffer, either not specify a directory (erase
;;  it) or explicitly use `.*' before the file-name substring.
;;
;;  For example, with `M-h', `/foo/bar/lph' will not apropos-match the
;;  previously input file name `/foo/bar/alphabet-soup.el'; you should
;;  use either `/foo/bar/.*lph' or `lph' (no directory).
;;
;;  In the case of `M-pause', however, the input is matched against
;;  the history list as restricted by the existing completion list.
;;  And, since apropos file-name completion uses only the relative
;;  file name, without the directory name, as a regexp, the candidate
;;  list that is restricted has already matched the input regexp.  The
;;  action of `M-pause' is simply to filter the list of candidates,
;;  keeping those that are in the history list.  This means that, with
;;  `M-pause', the input `/foo/bar/lph' will match against the
;;  previously input file name `/foo/bar/alphabet-soup.el'.
;;
;;  If this all sounds confusing, just give it a try; it is much
;;  harder to describe than it is to experience.
;;
;;  A final tip: You can clear (reset) the minibuffer history that is
;;  used for the current command, by using `M-:'
;;  (`icicle-pp-eval-expression') to evaluate the following Emacs-Lisp
;;  sexp during completion (note: `set', not `setq'):
;;
;;    (set minibuffer-history-variable nil)
 
;;(@* "Search Enhancements")
;;
;;  Search Enhancements
;;  -------------------
;;
;;  There are two, unrelated enhancements that Icicles provides for
;;  searching:
;;
;;  - An extension to standard Emacs incremental search that lets you
;;    use Icicles completion against previous search strings.
;;
;;  - Top-level Icicles commands that provide an entirely new and
;;    different way for you to search.
;;
;;(@* "Isearch Completion Against the Search History")
;;  ** Isearch Completion Against the Search History **
;;
;;  When you search incrementally (`C-s'), Emacs (21 or later) lets
;;  you complete your input to a string that you have looked for
;;  previously.  In Icicle mode, this feature is enhanced so that you
;;  can use all of the completion behavior provided by Icicles.
;;
;;  In vanilla Emacs, you use `M-TAB' to complete against the search
;;  ring (that is, the search history).  In Icicles, you use `S-TAB'
;;  (`icicle-isearch-complete') to do this - that's what Icicles users
;;  are in the habit of using for (apropos) completion.  They are also
;;  in the habit of using `TAB' for prefix completion, but in Isearch
;;  `TAB' inserts a tab, which is a useful character to include in
;;  search strings.
;;
;;  When you use `S-TAB' while searching, Isearch exits momentarily,
;;  giving way to Icicles completion in the minibuffer (Isearch
;;  actually uses the echo area, not the minibuffer).  You can then
;;  use either `S-TAB' or `TAB' to complete your search string.  After
;;  you finish completing (e.g. by hitting `RET'), Isearch resumes
;;  with the new, completed search string.  It's pretty seamless, and
;;  easier to try than to describe.
;;
;;  One reminder: Using `S-TAB' vs `TAB' for (regexp vs non-regexp)
;;  completion against previous search strings has nothing to do with
;;  regexp vs non-regexp searching.  You can of course use either kind
;;  of searching before or after having used either kind of
;;  completion.  Isearch uses different search rings for regexp and
;;  non-regexp searching.  The kind of search in progress (regexp or
;;  not) at the moment you call for completion determines which search
;;  ring provides the candidates for completion.
;;
;;(@* "Icicles Search Commands")
;;  ** Icicles Search Commands:
;;    `icicle-search', `icicle-occur', `icicle-imenu' **
;;
;;  The main idea behind the Icicles search commands `icicle-search'
;;  (`C-c `') and `icicle-occur' (`C-c '') is this: Regular
;;  expressions are powerful for searching, but they can also be
;;  cumbersome sometimes.  Why not use one simple regexp to set up a
;;  set of candidates and then use a second simple regexp to filter
;;  those candidates?  This is the same idea as that behind
;;  progressive completion with `M-*'.  (However, using `M-*' together
;;  with the search commands serves no purpose; its filtering is not
;;  cumulative in this context.)
;;
;;  Icicles search commands search the entire buffer, not just the
;;  part that follows the cursor.  If a region is active, however,
;;  then the search is confined to the region.
;;
;;  You've no doubt used standard Emacs command `occur'.  It finds all
;;  lines in a buffer that match a regexp that you enter.  It displays
;;  the matching lines as links in buffer *Occur* - you can click a
;;  link to navigate to the corresponding line in the original buffer.
;;  Using buffer *Occur* is similar to using the output of Emacs
;;  `grep' command.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-occur' is similar to `occur', but instead of
;;  entering a regexp (with `RET') you type a regexp and then use
;;  `S-TAB' to show the matching lines in buffer *Completions*.  As
;;  usual in Icicles, you can complete to a single candidate, or cycle
;;  among candidates to choose one.  To navigate to a match in the
;;  original buffer, use `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', `C-next', or `C-prior'.
;;  One advantage of `icicle-occur' is that you can change the regexp
;;  on the fly to match different sets of lines.  Another, major
;;  advantage is that you can use progressive completion to find lines
;;  using multiple, simple regexps.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-search' is a generalization of `icicle-occur'.
;;  You enter an initial regexp (using `RET'), which is used to define
;;  a set of completion candidates: all of the matching strings in the
;;  current buffer (by default).  Command `icicle-occur' is really
;;  `icicle-search' with an implicit initial regexp of `.*' (you do
;;  not enter that).  That is, the initial completion candidates for
;;  `icicle-occur' are all of the lines of the buffer.  With
;;  `icicle-search', the candidates need not be single, complete lines
;;  but can be any strings in the buffer, including multiple-line
;;  strings.  Your initial regexp is used over and over in the region
;;  or buffer that you search to find the set of matching strings,
;;  which then serve as completion candidates.
;;
;;  When you use `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', `C-next', or `C-prior', both
;;  `icicle-occur' and `icicle-search' highlight the current
;;  occurrence using face `icicle-search-main-regexp-current'.  For
;;  `icicle-occur', the current occurrence is the current line; for
;;  `icicle-search', it is whatever your initial regexp matches.
;;
;;  In addition, within the current occurrence, both `icicle-occur'
;;  and `icicle-search' highlight whatever your current input matches
;;  (using face `icicle-search-current-input').  For `icicle-search',
;;  this is whatever you type after you have entered the initial
;;  regexp with `RET' - typically, it is a second regexp used to
;;  refine the search.
;;
;;  If you provide a simple prefix argument (`C-u') to
;;  `icicle-search', then you can search multiple buffers - you are
;;  prompted for the buffers to search.  (Use `C-RET' and so on to
;;  choose individual buffers with completion.  Use `C-!' to choose
;;  all buffers or all buffers that match a regexp.  See
;;  (@> "Multi-Commands"), above.)
;;
;;  If you provide a numeric prefix argument (e.g. `M--' or `C-9') to
;;  `icicle-search', then you can search multiple regions, possibly in
;;  multiple buffers.  The regions are those in user option
;;  `icicle-region-alist', which you have previously defined using
;;  command `icicle-add-region'.  See (@> "Multiple Regions"), below.
;;
;;  User options for `icicle-search':
;;
;;  * If `icicle-add-buffer-name-flag' is non-nil (the default value),
;;    then, whenever you use a prefix argument, `icicle-search'
;;    annotates each candidate with the name of the buffer where the
;;    hit occurs, highlighted, to help orient you.  The buffer name is
;;    actually part of the (multi-completion) candidate, so you can
;;    match against it.  Note that even when the value of this option
;;    is nil, you can use `C-M-mouse-2' and so on to see the buffer
;;    name, as well as the position of the hit in the buffer.
;;
;;  * `icicle-search' highlights the first
;;    `icicle-search-highlight-threshold' matches for your initial
;;    regexp at once (using face `icicle-search-main-regexp-others').
;;    The effect is similar to the Emacs 22+ lazy search highlighting
;;    of `isearch' (except that the highlighting is not in fact lazy).
;;
;;  * If `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag' is non-nil, then
;;    `icicle-search' highlights your current input match within *all*
;;    main search hits at once.  The default value is nil, because
;;    this highlighting can impact performance negatively if there are
;;    many hits - the highlighting is updated with each input change.
;;    You can toggle this option at any time using command
;;    `icicle-toggle-highlight-all-current', bound to `C-^' in the
;;    minibuffer (except during file-name completion).
;;
;;  * If `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is non-nil (the default value)
;;    then search highlighting is removed after the search.  If you
;;    set this to nil then you can remove search highlighting manually
;;    later using command `icicle-search-highlight-cleanup'.  You can
;;    toggle this search highlight removal at any time using command
;;    `icicle-toggle-search-cleanup', bound to `C-.' in the minibuffer
;;    (except during file-name completion).  One use of nil
;;    `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is to highlight regexp matches
;;    throughout a region or buffer.  In that capacity,
;;    `icicle-search' acts like some of the highlighting commands in
;;    my library `highlight.el'.
;;
;;  * `icicle-search-hook': Functions run after searching and moving
;;    to a match, whether by `RET' or `C-RET' (or `C-next' or
;;    `C-prior').  See the definition of command
;;    `icicle-compilation-search' for an example of its use.
;;
;;  It can sometimes be useful to highlight all regexp matches using a
;;  large value of `icicle-search-highlight-threshold' and a nil value
;;  of `icicle-search-cleanup-flag', and then set
;;  `icicle-search-highlight-threshold' to zero and use
;;  `icicle-search' again with a different regexp to search through
;;  the same region or buffer.  This lets you see the relation between
;;  the two sets of regexp matches.
;;
;;  You can use `icicle-search' to find text entities of a certain
;;  kind - sentences, paragraphs, file names, URLs, and so on.  A
;;  convenient way to do this is to use `C-=' in the minibuffer
;;  (`icicle-insert-string-from-variable') to insert a predefined
;;  regexp that matches a particular kind of text entity.
;;
;;  For example, suppose you are in a mail client and you want to move
;;  between mail headers.  If you use a regexp that matches the header
;;  field you want (e.g. the sent date or sender) then `icicle-search'
;;  highlights all such occurrences and lets you navigate among them -
;;  instant mail browser!  Or, suppose you are in a C++ or Perl file
;;  and you want to navigate among function or other definitions.  If
;;  you have a canned regexp that matches the start of a definition,
;;  then you can use `C-=' to quickly turn `icicle-search' into a code
;;  browser.  In a log file, navigate among date or time entries or IP
;;  addresses...  Of course, most programming modes and mail clients
;;  already provide other ways to navigate, but you get the idea -
;;  `icicle-search' provides a general way to navigate among things,
;;  as long as you can match them with regexps, and `C-=' lets you
;;  quickly access a library of predefined regexps.
;;
;;  You can find useful regexps to store in variables in the standard
;;  Emacs Lisp libraries.  Grep for `font-lock-keywords' or `regexp'
;;  in the Emacs `lisp' directory and its subdirectories.
;;
;;   See `align.el' for regexps for programming languages.
;;   See `url-dav.el' for regexps matching iso8601 dates.
;;   See `rmail.el', `sendmail.el', and `mh-show.el' for regexps
;;   matching mail-header fields.
;;
;;  Imenu regexps occurring as parts of different values of
;;  `imenu-generic-expression' for different buffer types can be used
;;  as variable values for `C-='.  They all work fine with
;;  `icicle-search', turning it into a navigator for the given mode.
;;  See, for example, `generic-x.el' and `lisp-mode.el'.  Here is a
;;  regexp for Javascript function definitions from `generic-x.el':
;;
;;   "^function\\s-+\\([A-Za-z0-9_]+\\)"
;;
;;  And `lisp-imenu-generic-expression' (in `lisp-mode.el') provides
;;  regexps for Lisp function, variable, and type definitions.  Here
;;  is the variable-definition regexp:
;;
;;   "^\\s-*(\\(def\\(c\\(onst\\(ant\\)?\\|ustom\\)\\|ine-symbol-macro
;;   \\|parameter\\|var\\)\\)\\s-+\\(\\(\\sw\\|\\s_\\)+\\)"
;;
;;  You certainly don't want to type that into the minibuffer (and the
;;  function-definition regexp is twice as complex)!  Put it into a
;;  variable once and use `C-=' from then on to retrieve it - simple.
;;
;;  If it's so simple then why not let a command do it?  Done.  Just
;;  use command `icicle-imenu'; it is an Imenu browser.  You don't
;;  need to bother looking up Imenu regexps and assigning them to
;;  variables for use with `C-=' and `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  If you look at the definition of `icicle-imenu' you'll see that it
;;  simply lets you choose an Imenu submenu appropriate for the
;;  current buffer type, and then it calls `icicle-search'.  That's
;;  the real point here: you can define your own commands similarly
;;  using `icicle-search' to browse regexp matches.  You get all of
;;  the features of `icicle-search' when you do this.  For example,
;;  `icicle-imenu' gives you these advantages over a standard Imenu
;;  menu:
;;
;;  * You can restrict navigation (search) to a region.
;;
;;  * You can navigate (browse) among multiple entries, instead of
;;    choosing them one by one from a menu.
;;
;;  * You can restrict the entries to browse using (regexp) pattern
;;    matching.
;;
;;  In sum: For complete interactivity, type a regexp dynamically as
;;  input to `icicle-search'.  For isolated special regexps that you
;;  use, save them in variables and use `C-=' with `icicle-search'.
;;  For well-defined sets of regexps, especially if used frequently,
;;  define a command that uses `icicle-search'.  There is a spectrum
;;  of use cases for `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-search' is very general and very powerful.  It
;;  might never replace incremental search - either regexp or literal
;;  string search, but in some cases it can be quite handy.  Think of
;;  it as another tool to add to your search-tool belt.  Admittedly,
;;  it does take a little getting used to.  Remember, in particular,
;;  that the initial regexp you enter (with `RET') cannot be changed
;;  without re-executing `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  And remember too that `C-l' (`icicle-retrieve-last-input') is your
;;  friend - it clears the minibuffer during cycling, retrieving your
;;  last real input.  Use it to modify your second and subsequent
;;  regexps on the fly - those that filter the initial candidate list
;;  further.
;;
;;  Oh - And don't forget that you can do things like take the
;;  complement of your fine-tuning regexp matches, within the context
;;  of your coarse-tuning matches.
;;  See (@> "Sets of Completion Candidates"), above.
;;
;;  For example, use `^.*defun.*$' as the main regexp, to find all
;;  lines containing `defun'.  Then type `icicle' to match only the
;;  lines with `defun' that also contain `icicle'.  Then complement
;;  (`C-~') that set, to see the lines that contain `defun' but not
;;  `icicle'.
;;
;;  And you can then save that set of matches, and then subtract it
;;  from another set of matches in a different search...  You get the
;;  idea.  When performing set operations combined with
;;  `icicle-search', keep in mind that the saved set does not include
;;  any position information - it is only a set of matching strings.
;;  So, in particular, a set-union operation (`C-+') is not useful
;;  with `icicle-search' (adding a saved set of strings without
;;  positions is useless).  Still, you can do things like match lines
;;  that contain `defun' followed somewhere by `()', and then subtract
;;  the (saved) set of lines in the same region that contain `icicle'.
;;  Try it in an Icicles library, using regexps `.*icicle.*$' and
;;  `^*.defun.*().*$'.
;;
;;  One more reminder: When you save a set of completion candidates
;;  (`C-M->'), make sure that you actually have a set of candidates to
;;  save!  It is not enough to just enter a regexp at the
;;  `icicle-search' prompt.  You must also use some Icicles command,
;;  such as `TAB', `S-TAB', `next', or `down' to tell Icicles how to
;;  create the candidate set - how to match the regexp.

;;
;;  Multiple Regions
;;  ----------------
;;
;;  Icicles lets you define multiple regions, which you can then act
;;  on individually or together.  The regions can be in any buffers:
;;  any number of regions in any number of buffers.
;;
;;  The multiple Icicles regions are saved persistently in user option
;;  `icicle-region-alist'.  You can customize this option directly,
;;  but it is usually easier and less error-prone to define the list
;;  of regions incrementally, using command `icicle-add-region' (`C-N
;;  C-x C-x', for N = 0,1,2,...), which adds the current Emacs region
;;  to `icicle-region-alist'.  You can remove one or more regions from
;;  `icicle-region-alist', using command `icicle-remove-region' or by
;;  customizing the option.  You can remove all regions in a given
;;  buffer, using command `icicle-remove-all-regions-in-buffer'.
;;
;;  You can use multi-command `icicle-select-region' (`C-u C-x C-x) to
;;  choose any region in `icicle-region-alist', navigate to it, and
;;  activate it.  You can use this as a sort of bookmark mechanism,
;;  retrieving saved regions later for operations in different Emacs
;;  sessions.  Unlike Emacs bookmarks, Icicles regions are not limited
;;  to being in file buffers - any buffer can be used.
;;
;;  You can also think of Icicles region definition and selection as a
;;  kind of tagging mechanism.  You can assign any identifying tag,
;;  and you can assign the same tag to multiple regions, whether they
;;  are in the same buffer or in different buffers.  You can also
;;  assign multiple tags to the same region, but in that case there
;;  will be multiple entries for that region in `icicle-region-alist':
;;  each entry corresponds to a single tag and a single region.  The
;;  default tag proposed when you add a region to
;;  `icicle-region-alist' is the first
;;  `icicle-regions-name-length-max' characters of the region itself.
;;
;;  The tag text is not added to your buffers.  It is recorded,
;;  together with the region limits, the buffer name, and the buffer's
;;  associated file name, in variable `icicle-region-alist'.  Each
;;  region is defined by its recorded limits.  Its tag is used only to
;;  identify it as a completion candidate.  This means that if a
;;  region tag was defined as the text at the beginning of the region
;;  (the default tag value), and you have changed the region's buffer
;;  (inserting or deleting text) since that definition, then the tag
;;  might no longer correspond exactly to the current region prefix.
;;
;;  For commands such as `icicle-select-region' that use
;;  `icicle-region-alist', there is generally little sense in using
;;  regions as completion candidates if they are in buffers that no
;;  longer exist and are not associated with files.  For this reason,
;;  such regions are filtered out for completion.  They remain
;;  recorded in `icicle-region-alist', however, and if a non-existent
;;  buffer is re-created, then it will once again be available as a
;;  completion candidate.
;;
;;  Buffers associated with files are an important special case: the
;;  files can be opened, re-creating the buffers, and then the regions
;;  can be accessed.  For this reason, buffers associated with files
;;  are always made available as completion candidates.  When you
;;  choose such a candidate, the file is automatically visited,
;;  provided it is readable.
;;
;;  In addition to this automatic opening of individual files on
;;  demand, you can at any time open all of the (readable) files
;;  listed in `icicle-region-alist', using command
;;  `icicle-region-open-all-files'.  And, if user option
;;  `icicle-region-auto-open-files-flag' is non-nil, then all files
;;  listed in `icicle-region-alist' are visited automatically, as soon
;;  as you invoke any Icicles command that uses that alist.
;;
;;  In Icicle mode, `C-x C-x' is bound to command
;;  `icicle-exchange-point-and-mark'.  With no prefix argument, this
;;  is the same as `exchange-point-and-mark': it swaps the position of
;;  the text cursor and the mark and activates the region.  With a
;;  numeric prefix argument, this is the same as `icicle-add-region':
;;  it adds the current region to `icicle-region-alist'.  With a plain
;;  `C-u' prefix argument, this is the same as `icicle-select-region'.
;;
;;  You can search any region in `icicle-region-alist' using command
;;  `icicle-search-region'.  Because this is a multi-command, you can
;;  search any number of the regions, one at a time.  You can also
;;  search through all of the regions at once, using a special feature
;;  of command `icicle-search' (`C-`').  Provide a numeric prefix
;;  argument to `icicle-search' (e.g. `C-9 C-`'), and the regions in
;;  `icicle-region-alist' become the search space.
;;
;;  Commands `icicle-remove-region', `icicle-search-region', and
;;  `icicle-select-region' are multi-commands.  You can act on any
;;  number of regions using `C-RET' and so on.  Help on region
;;  candidates (`C-M-RET' and so on) displays the following
;;  information about the candidate region, in the minibuffer:
;;
;;   - its start and end positions in the buffer
;;   - its buffer
;;   - the buffer's associated file, if any
;;   - its length
;;
;;  (Command `icicle-remove-all-regions-in-buffer' is also a
;;  multi-command, but its completion candidates are buffers, not
;;  regions.)
;;
;;  For commands `icicle-select-region' and `icicle-search-region', if
;;  user option `icicle-add-buffer-name-flag' is non-nil (the default
;;  value), then each region-name candidate is annotated with the name
;;  of the region's buffer, highlighted, to help orient you.  The
;;  buffer name is actually part of the (multi-completion) candidate,
;;  so you can match against it.  As mentioned, even when the value of
;;  `icicle-add-buffer-name-flag' is nil, you can use `C-M-mouse-2'
;;  and so on to see the candidate region's buffer name.

;;
;;  Other Icicles Search Commands
;;  -----------------------------
;;
;;  Function `icicle-search' is very general.  As is explained in
;;  "Search Enhancements", above, `icicle-occur' is defined trivially
;;  using `icicle-search' - it is basically `icicle-search' with a
;;  regexp of `.*', to match lines.
;;
;;  Similarly, other Icicles commands are available that all make use
;;  of `icicle-search'.  And you can define your own, specialized
;;  search commands along the same lines.  It's instructive to look at
;;  the source code of the commands described in this section; that
;;  can serve as a model for defining your own search commands.
;;
;;  Like `icicle-search', each of the commands described here is bound
;;  to `C-c `' (backquote) in Icicle mode.  This shadow binding occurs
;;  if the current major mode is a compilation mode or an

;;  commands for particular buffers.]
;;
;;(@* "Compile/Grep Search")
;;  ** Compile/Grep Search **
;;
;;  In a compilation-results buffer, such as `*grep*', command
;;  `icicle-compilation-search' can be useful for searching among the
;;  result set (hits).  It is the same function as `icicle-search',
;;  except that it calls `compile-goto-error' as the
;;  completion-candidate action function.  That is, you can use
;;  `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', `C-prior', `C-next', `C-up', and `C-down' to
;;  display the target corresponding to each line in the compilation
;;  buffer that matches a regexp.  As for `icicle-search', you can
;;  further narrow the match candidates by typing a second regexp to
;;  search for among the first matches.
;;
;;  Altogether, using this with `grep' gives you two or three levels
;;  of regexp searching: 1) the `grep' regexp, 2) the major
;;  `icicle-search' regexp, and optionally 3) a refining
;;  `icicle-search' regexp.  And you can of course use progressive
;;  completion (`M-*') to add any number of additional levels.
;;
;;(@* "Input Reuse in Interactive Interpreter Modes")
;;  ** Input Reuse in Interactive Interpreter Modes **
;;
;;  In an interactive interpreter mode such as `shell-mode' or
;;  interactive Lisp mode, you can search for and reuse a previous
;;  input, possibly editing it first.  `C-c `', bound to command
;;  `icicle-comint-search', lets you use Icicles completion and
;;  cycling to access previous inputs; it uses `icicle-search', so it
;;  highlights your regexp input and so on.  You can use `C-$' at any
;;  time to toggle removal of duplicate past inputs as completion
;;  candidates; by default, duplicates are removed.
;;
;;  Being a search command, however, `icicle-comint-search' has access
;;  only to the commands that are visible in the buffer.  It does not
;;  use the `comint-input-ring', so it cannot, for instance, give you
;;  access to commands used in a previous session, which might have
;;  been recorded in a history file.
;;
;;  Another Icicles command, `icicle-comint-command', which is not a
;;  search command, does use `comint-input-ring' and does give you
;;  completion and cycling against previous inputs that might not have
;;  come from the current session.  It is bound to `C-c TAB' in
;;  `comint-mode' and derived modes.

;;  -------------------------
;;
;;  Icicles can help with Info in these ways:
;;
;;  * Icicles completion is available for any input.
;;
;;  * You can use `icicle-search' on part or all of a manual, if you

;;
;;(@* "Icicles Completion for Info")
;;  ** Icicles Completion for Info **
;;
;;  Whenever completion is available for Info commands, such as `g'
;;  (`Info-goto-node') or `i' (`Info-index'), you can take advantage
;;  of Icicles completion.  For instance, if you type `g yan', you can
;;  use `S-TAB' for apropos completion and choose node `Isearch Yank',
;;  whose name contains `yan' but does not start with it.  This is an
;;  obvious and standard Icicles feature.
;;
;;  Although vanilla Emacs also accepts a substring as input for `i',
;;  it does not provide substring or regexp completion, and it won't
;;  accept a regexp as final input.
;;
;;  Icicles binds `g' and `i' to multi-commands
;;  `icicle-Info-goto-node' and `icicle-Info-index', which means that
;;  you can also use `g' and `i' with `C-next', `C-RET', `C-mouse-2',
;;  and so on, to browse among matching Info nodes.  Unlike browsing
;;  with repeated use of `,' after `i' in vanilla Emacs, you can
;;  continue to see all of the matching candidates, in buffer
;;  *Completions*, and you need not visit the index hits in sequential
;;  order.
;;
;;(@* "Using Icicle-Search With Info")
;;  ** Using Icicle-Search With Info **
;;
;;  Icicles searching (`icicle-search') is not incremental searching.
;;  It searches for all matches in the portion of text you tell it to
;;  search.  This means that you cannot use it to search an entire
;;  manual in one operation, unless you have the entire manual
;;  available in a single buffer to be searched.
;;
;;  So, when you use `icicle-search' (`C-`') to search with Info, you
;;  are limited to a few options:
;;
;;  * You can use it normally, to search within a single Info node.
;;
;;  * You can widen the visible region (`C-x n w'), to use it on an
;;    entire Info file.  However:
;;
;;    1. It is not obvious how a given Info manual is divided into
;;       files.  That is, you need to be aware of the point at which
;;       the manual moves from one file to the next.
;;
;;    2. Only the nodes in the same file that you have already visited
;;       are highlighted, and lots of ugly Info "plumbing" becomes
;;       visible in the other nodes.
;;
;;    3. You lose all Info features, such as navigation using links.
;;
;;  * There is another way to search across nodes, which addresses #1
;;    and #2, but still does not give you navigable links and such.
;;    Think of it as a hack that can sometimes be handy.  That is what
;;    is described below.
;;
;;  The idea is to flatten a subtree of Info nodes - possibly an
;;  entire manual, but more typically a node and its children - and
;;  then use `icicle-search' (`C-`') over that flattened document.
;;  What is needed is a command that flattens Info subtrees.  Library
;;  `info+.el' provides such a command, `Info-merge-subnodes', and
;;  binds it to `+' in Info.
;;
;;  You can control how you want the flattening to occur, by using
;;  different values of prefix argument.  For searching, you probably
;;  want complete flattening of the chosen subtree, in a single
;;  buffer, so you use a prefix arg of zero: `C-u 0 +'.
;;
;;  This does not replace the *Info* buffer that you started with; it
;;  creates a new buffer, named after the root node of the subtree you
;;  flattened.  A principle use of `Info-merge-subnodes' is to print
;;  out a manual or a portion of it.  Also, I wrote a library
;;  (`mkhtml.el', outdated now) that lets you convert the result to
;;  HTML.
;;
;;  In sum, you can use Icicles search in Info: `C-u 0 +', then `C-`'.
;;
;;  One caveat, however: You will generally want to limit your search
;;  to a reasonably small subtree of a manual, instead of flattening
;;  and then searching the entire manual.  Flattening a large manual
;;  can take a while: it took me 10 minutes to flatten the Emacs
;;  Manual.  Of course, you could flatten a large manual once, and
;;  save the result in a file for later searches.
;;
;;  Obviously, flattening in order to search is less convenient than
;;  using manual-wide incremental search (`C-s') with Info (starting
;;  with Emacs 22), and it is often less convenient than using
;;  `Info-search' (bound to `s' in Info).  Icicles searching is
;;  different from both, and it has its advantages and disadvantages.
;;  When you want the advantages of Icicles searching in Info, the
;;  flattening hack can be useful.  When you don't need those
;;  advantages, other search methods can sometimes be more
;;  appropriate.

;;
;;  Using Complex Completion Candidates
;;  -----------------------------------
;;
;;  This section could also be called "Mapping over Sets", because it
;;  is about applying some function to members of a set of completion
;;  candidates.  You already know that you can manipulate sets of
;;  candidates - see (@> "Sets of Completion Candidates"), above.  The
;;  elements of those sets are strings; you choose candidate names.
;;  Sometimes, however, you need to choose among named items that are
;;  themselves complex, containing more information than just the
;;  name.  That is the idea behind command `icicle-map', which this
;;  section introduces.
;;
;;  You (or a command that you use) can obtain the information
;;  associated with a name after you choose the name, whether during
;;  multi-command cycling (see (@> "Multi-Commands"), above) or after
;;  final candidate choice (`RET').  This is what happens, for
;;  instance, when you use `find-file'; the command looks up the file
;;  associated with the name after you choose the name.  Likewise, for
;;  `icicle-bookmark' and other commands.  Multi-commands need to
;;  perform this lookup both when you use a candidate while cycling
;;  and when you make a final candidate selection.
;;
;;  Names and their associated information can be available in Emacs
;;  Lisp in the form of an association list (alist), that is, a list
;;  whose items are conses.  An alist is often used to represent a
;;  function or relation that maps one set of things to another.  The
;;  conses in the alist are the tuples (typically pairs) of related
;;  items.  The car of each cons is called its "key"; the cdr is
;;  called its "value".  Different alists have different kinds of keys
;;  and values.  Typical key types include symbols and strings;
;;  typical value types include symbols, strings, numbers, and lists.
;;  There are quite a few standard Emacs-Lisp variables whose value is
;;  an alist.  Most are internal variables, but some are user options.
;;  See the Emacs-Lisp manual for more about alists.
;;
;;  The completion mechanism of Emacs function `completing-read' takes
;;  an alist as input: the keys are completion-candidate strings.  For
;;  completion, however, the value (cdr) of each alist key/value entry
;;  is completely ignored.  Icicles uses `completing-read', so it
;;  works the same way.  If a command needs to access the value
;;  associated with a name, then it must somehow do so independently
;;  of completion.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-search' offers an example of this.  The completion
;;  alist contains key/value pairs whose car (key) is a buffer string
;;  that matches your search string and whose cdr (value) is the
;;  corresponding buffer position.  When you use completion with this
;;  command, you work only with the keys, but `icicle-search' keeps
;;  track of the corresponding positions for you as well.  The logic
;;  for doing this is coded into the definition of `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  It is common to want to do something interesting interactively
;;  with the values, not just the keys, of a completion alist.  Why
;;  lose the important value information when you choose a key?  And
;;  instead of requiring the logic of each command to deal with this
;;  need separately, why not provide a general mechanism for accessing
;;  this information - both by program and interactively?  This is
;;  what command `icicle-map' is for.
;;
;;  To make use of completion-alist values, you need to access the cdr
;;  of a key/value pair.  However, different alists are structured
;;  differently: the cdr can itself be complex (structured).  In
;;  general, you want to access the key/value pair as a whole, to do
;;  what you want with it, that is, to apply some function to it.
;;
;;  Emacs-Lisp programmers sometimes map functions over lists to
;;  obtain a different list.  For example, mapping the function `1+'
;;  over the list (3 1 4 1 5 9) gives the list (4 2 5 2 6 10).  The
;;  command `icicle-map' is inspired by this common practice, but it
;;  applies only to alists, and it lets you choose interactively which
;;  list elements to use.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-map' lets you apply a function of your choice
;;  (choose the function via completion, if you like) to any number of
;;  key/value entries in an alist.  The alist is used for completion,
;;  so you can choose among the possible keys.  But the function is
;;  applied to the corresponding key/value pairs, not to just the
;;  keys.
;;
;;  For example, given the alist `auto-mode-alist' and the function
;;  `cdr', you can choose to apply `cdr' to selected alist entries.
;;  This acts as a simple lookup function, because `cdr' just returns
;;  the value associated with a chosen key.  If you choose, for
;;  example, the candidate (key) "\.el\'", then the result is the
;;  symbol `emacs-lisp-mode'.  In this case, the chosen key/value pair
;;  is ("\\.el\\'" . emacs-lisp-mode).  (A literal backslash must be
;;  doubled in an Emacs-Lisp string.)
;;
;;  Function `cdr' returns the value, which is `emacs-lisp-mode' here.
;;  If, instead of `cdr', you use the function (lambda (x)
;;  (describe-function (cdr x))), then the result of choosing
;;  candidate "\.el\'" is to display the help for function
;;  `emacs-lisp-mode'.  Yes, you can type in a lambda expression when
;;  prompted for the function - any function can be used.  Keep in
;;  mind, however, that the function must target a key/value pair
;;  (cons).  This is why you could not simply use `describe-function'
;;  as the function here.
;;
;;  So what is `icicle-map' really for?  Anything you want.  You can
;;  use it to simply browse an alist or to perform actions on things.
;;  The idea is to let you take advantage of Icicles features to
;;  interactively filter and manipulate a set of completion keys, and
;;  then apply any function you like to them - not just to the keys,
;;  but to the keys or their values, or both.
;;
;;  You can use apropos (regexp) matching or prefix matching to filter
;;  the alist, as always, during completion.  You can use `C-next',
;;  `C-RET', and so on to act on (that is, apply the function to)
;;  selected key/value pairs that match your current input, or you can
;;  use `C-!' to act on *all* such pairs.  The latter case corresponds
;;  to mapping a function over all of the items in a list.
;;
;;  As an Emacs-Lisp programmer, you can use function `icicle-map'
;;  programmatically to let users look things up in alists that you
;;  construct or to act on selected alist entries in complex ways.
;;  Icicles just provides the interactive completion features.  The
;;  real value of `icicle-map' comes from what you do with it.  Use it
;;  with a database of geographical coordinates to look up location
;;  names provided by users and draw corresponding vicinity maps.  Use
;;  it with a list of hardware configurations to let users perform
;;  diagnostic or maintenance operations on selected equipment.  You
;;  get the idea - use your imagination.
;;
;;  Note: Although completion alists normally require string-valued
;;  keys, `icicle-map' is designed to work with any alist.
 
;;(@* "Icicles OO: Object-Action Interaction")
;;
;;  Icicles OO: Object-Action Interaction
;;  --------------------------------------
;;
;;  Here's another crazy Icicles feature: Instead of choosing a
;;  function (e.g. command) and then the object to apply it to, choose
;;  the object first and then the function.
;;
;;  The first thing to say about this feature is that Emacs is not
;;  really designed for this, so it's not feasible to do this in a
;;  completely satisfactory way.  In particular, there is no practical
;;  way, given an object, to find all of the functions that apply to
;;  it.
;;
;;  The second thing to say is that there are three ways that Icicles
;;  helps you operate on a chosen object of a given type.  The first
;;  is apropos completion, which you can use to narrow the set of
;;  commands to those that have the object type in their name.  You
;;  still choose the command before the individual object, but you at
;;  least choose the object type first (which narrows the set of
;;  possible objects).
;;
;;  If you use Icicles, you already use apropos completion this way,
;;  but you might not have thought about it in these terms.  If you
;;  want to invoke some command on a buffer, you might start by typing
;;  `M-x buffer S-TAB' or `M-x buff S-TAB'.  This is simple, but it
;;  really does get you most of the way toward object-action
;;  interaction.  And you can of course then use progressive
;;  completion (`M-*') to filter the matching commands for additional
;;  object-type names; for example `M-* window' keeps only those
;;  commands whose names contain both `buffer' and `window'.  Of
;;  course, this requires the command name to actually advertise
;;  truthfully the object types that it operates on.  There are false
;;  positives and true negatives, but Emacs is generally quite helpful
;;  in this respect.
;;
;;  The second way that Icicles helps with object-action interaction
;;  is the minibuffer binding of `M-RET' during completion.  Whenever
;;  you are cycling through completion candidates, `M-RET' enters a
;;  recursive edit that prompts you for a function to apply to the
;;  current candidate.  Regardless of what the initial command was
;;  that you started to execute, if it reads an object name with
;;  completion, just cycle to that name and hit `M-RET'.  `M-mouse-2'
;;  does the same thing, so you don't even have to cycle to get to the
;;  candidate you want.  For example, if the current candidate is a
;;  buffer named `foo.el', then `M-RET' prompts you for a function to
;;  apply to it.  (Actually, the function is applied to the completion
;;  candidate, which is the buffer name in this case, but many
;;  functions accept an object name in place of the object.)
;;
;;  The function you enter can be anything; it need not be a command,
;;  and it need not be the name of a function: you can type a lambda
;;  expression that accepts an argument of the appropriate type.  The
;;  function is read with completion: you can complete a function name
;;  (the completion is non-strict, to allow for a lambda expression).
;;  Note that the domain of discourse for completion is the set of
;;  *all* named functions, regardless of the target object.  It is up
;;  to you to choose an appropriate function.
;;
;;  Using a lambda expression here is a good way to "curry" a function
;;  that requires multiple arguments, so that it adapts to expect just
;;  a single argument of the appropriate object type.  For example,
;;  (lambda (sym-name) (get (intern (sym-name)) 'invisible))
;;  transforms function `get', which takes a symbol and a property, to
;;  a function that takes a symbol name and looks up the `invisible'
;;  property of the symbol.
;;
;;  If you use a prefix argument (`C-u M-RET' or `C-u M-mouse-2'),
;;  then the result of the function application is pretty-printed.
;;  Otherwise, the function is called for effect only.
;;
;;  The third way that Icicles helps with object-action interaction is
;;  provided by command `icicle-object-action'.  This reads an
;;  object-type name, with completion; then it reads an object of that
;;  type, with completion; then it reads a function (name or lambda
;;  expression) to apply to the object, with (non-strict) completion.
;;  Again, use a prefix argument if you want to pretty-print the
;;  result.
;;
;;  The object types here fall into two classes: 
;;
;;  1. Objects, such as frames, that are easily associated with names.
;;  2. Objects, such as sequences, that are not easily named (though
;;     they might be assigned or bound to a symbol, which has a name.)
;;
;;  The completion candidates for objects that are not easily named
;;  are symbols whose values are the objects.  The object-type names
;;  used for these candidates are really Emacs-Lisp type predicate
;;  names, which all end in `p', except for `atom'.  For example, if
;;  you choose `sequencep' as the object type, then the object
;;  candidates will be all of the symbols whose value is a sequence.
;;
;;  Objects that are naturally associated with names are treated
;;  differently, depending on the type.  The following object types
;;  are used for named objects: `buffer', `command', `face', `frame',
;;  `function', `option', `process', `symbol', `variable', `window'.
;;  For all of these except `window', the name of the object is used.
;;  For `window', the candidate objects are the names of the buffers
;;  that are currently shown in a window (on any frame).
;;
;;  You'll note that some types are treated both ways, 1) using named
;;  objects and 2) using symbols whose values are objects.  An example
;;  is `frame' and `framep': the completion candidates (objects) for
;;  type `frame' are frame names; the candidates for type `framep' are
;;  symbols whose values are frames.

;;  Multi-Completions
;;  -----------------

;;  to an input regexp, and displays the hits.  It can be useful when
;;  you don't remember the name of a function or variable but you can
;;  guess at terms that might occur in its doc string.  Typically,
;;  people resort to it only after first trying apropos commands that
;;  match against the function or variable name.
;;
;;(@* "icicle-doc, icicle-vardoc, icicle-fundoc, icicle-plist")
;;  ** icicle-doc, icicle-vardoc, icicle-fundoc, icicle-plist **
;;
;;  The idea behind `apropos-documentation' also motivates Icicles
;;  commands `icicle-doc', `icicle-vardoc', `icicle-fundoc', and
;;  `icicle-plist'.  These are multi-commands (see
;;  (@> "Multi-Commands"), above), so you can use `C-RET' and `C-next'
;;  to browse the regexp matches, displaying the documentation of each
;;  match in turn, and you can change the regexp to get different
;;  matches during the same command invocation.
;;
;;  Like `apropos-documentation', `icicle-doc' lets you match a regexp
;;  against the doc strings of symbols such as functions, variables,
;;  and faces.  Commands `icicle-vardoc' and `icicle-fundoc' work a
;;  bit differently.  They let you match both the name and the doc
;;  string, using two different regexps.  Command `icicle-plist' lets
;;  you match both a symbol name and its property list (as a string);
;;  you can use it to find symbols with certain property-list keys or
;;  values.
;;
;;  The way `icicle-vardoc', `icicle-fundoc', and `icicle-plist' work
;;  is a bit inelegant, and it can take some getting used to.  You
;;  provide two regexps, one to match the name of a symbol (e.g. a
;;  function or variable) and one to match its doc string (or property
;;  list, in the case of `icicle-plist').  However, since completion
;;  candidates are not multipart, you actually type a single regexp
;;  that is the concatenation of the two.  You join these two regexps
;;  using `icicle-list-join-string' (a user option), which, by
;;  default, is `^G^J', that is, a control-G character followed by a
;;  control-J (newline) character.  As always, you input control
;;  characters using `C-q', so to input `^G^J' you use `C-q C-g C-q
;;  C-j'.
;;
;;  For instance, to match a function name that contains `dired' and a
;;  doc string that contains `file', you would use this:
;;
;;    M-x icicle-fundoc dired^G^Jfile
;;
;;  That is, you type:
;;
;;    M-x icicle-fundoc dired C-q C-g C-q C-j file
;;
;;  Well, almost.  The way it works is that the completion candidates
;;  are themselves formed by concatenating symbol names with their doc
;;  strings, using `icicle-list-join-string'.  Your input regexp is
;;  matched against those candidates.  This means that the input
;;  regexp `dired^G^Jfile' would actually match only function names
;;  that *end* with `dired' and doc strings that *begin* with `file'.
;;
;;  To match `file' against any part of the doc string, you must
;;  explicitly link the two component regexps with a regexp that
;;  matches anything.  If you want to search only the first lines of
;;  doc strings, you can use `.*' to do that: `dired.*^G^J.*file' will
;;  match all functions whose names contain `dired' and whose doc
;;  strings' first lines contain `file'.  This is because `.' does not
;;  match newline characters.
;;
;;  If you want to search the entire doc strings (or property lists,
;;  for `icicle-plist'), then you can use a connecting regexp such as
;;  `[^^G]*', which matches any sequence of characters except
;;  character `^G'.  To match any character, even `^G', you can use
;;  `\(.\|^J\)'.  (It's too bad that Emacs doesn't have a
;;  dot-matches-newline-too option.)
;;
;;  Here, `.*' is used to match anything following `dired' in the
;;  function name, and `[^^G]*' is used to match anything (including
;;  newline) before `file' in the doc string.
;;
;;    M-x icicle-fundoc dired.*^G^J[^^G]*file
;;
;;  That is, you type (without the spaces):
;;
;;    M-x icicle-fundoc dired.* C-q C-g C-q C-j [^ C-q C-g]* file
;;
;;(@* "How Multi-Completions Work")
;;  ** How Multi-Completions Work **
;;
;;  These commands that accept a multipart regexp are examples of
;;  Icicles "multi-completion".  Icicles extends standard function
;;  `completing-read' so that it will accept, as the set of completion
;;  candidates, an alist argument whose candidates are not only
;;  individual strings but can also be lists of strings.  Each string
;;  in the list is one part of a multipart completion candidate, that
;;  is, a multi-completion.  The strings are joined together pairwise
;;  using `icicle-list-join-string' by `completing-read'.  Commands
;;  `icicle-fundoc' and`icicle-vardoc' each use lists of two strings
;;  (name and doc), but a multi-completion can have any number of
;;  strings.
;;
;;  Why is the default value of `icicle-list-join-string' so odd:
;;  `^G^J'?  You can use any string you like, but here is the
;;  rationale behind the default choice:
;;
;;  - ^G does not normally occur in simple strings such as doc strings
;;  - a newline (^J) visually separates the multiple component strings
;;  - ^G^J is not too difficult to enter: `C-q C-g C-q C-j'
;;
;;  It is important that the value of `icicle-list-join-string' not be
;;  something that is, itself, likely to match any of the candidates.
;;  Otherwise, it would not serve its role as separator.
;;
;;  I find that it helps a bit (in Emacs 22 or later) to customize
;;  face `escape-glyph', which is used for control characters such as
;;  `^G', in such a way that it stands out a bit, especially because
;;  control characters can be used in regexps that also use `^' as a
;;  special character.  I use a gold background with a blue foreground
;;  for this face.
;;
;;  Because multi-completions often extend over multiple lines, and
;;  candidates in buffer *Completion* appear one right after the
;;  other, it's helpful to add additional separation between
;;  multi-completion candidates.  That is the purpose of user option
;;  `icicle-list-end-string', whose default value is "^J^J" (two
;;  newline characters).  It is automatically appended to each
;;  candidate, for purposes of both display and matching.  Remember
;;  that it is part of each multi-completion candidate, especially if
;;  you use a regexp that ends in `$', matching the end of the
;;  candidate.
;;
;;(@* "Multi-Completions vs `completing-read-multiple'")
;;  ** Multi-Completions vs `completing-read-multiple' **
;;
;;  Note that there is (only) a superficial similarity between Icicles
;;  multi-completion and the functionality provided by function
;;  `completing-read-multiple' of standard Emacs library `crm.el'.
;;  The latter lets you complete multiple strings in the minibuffer,
;;  one at a time.  It involves ordinary Emacs prefix completion, and
;;  it uses the same set of completion candidates for each of the
;;  strings in the input.
;;
;;  By contrast, Icicles multi-completion completes each part of your
;;  input against a different set of completion candidates.  For
;;  example, when you use `icicle-vardoc', it completes the
;;  variable-name part of your input against the names of defined
;;  variables, and the variable-description part against the doc
;;  strings of defined variables.  Standard Emacs command
;;  `completing-read-multiple' lets you complete several different
;;  variable names at the same minibuffer prompt, but they each
;;  complete against the same set of variable names.
;;
;;  Multi-completion matches a list of regexps in parallel.  See also
;;  the description of `M-*', which matches a list of regexps in
;;  series: (@> "Progressive Completion").
;;
;;  See Also: (@> "Programming Multi-Completions") for information
;;  about changing the appearance and behavior of Icicles
;;  multi-completions using Emacs-Lisp code.
 
;;(@* "Completion in Other Buffers")
;;
;;  Completion in Other Buffers
;;  ---------------------------
;;
;;  In addition to input completion, you can use Icicles to complete
;;  words and symbols in other buffers, besides the minibuffer.
;;  Icicles enhances this completion in these ways:
;;
;;  1. Lisp symbol completion via `ESC-TAB' (`lisp-complete-symbol').
;;
;;  2. Word completion using the dynamic abbreviation of standard
;;     Emacs library `dabbrev.el'.
;;
;;  3. Word completion using the words and phrases in a thesaurus
;;
;;  4. Completion of shell commands, using previous inputs as
;;     candidates.  Likewise for any other interpreter.
;;
;;  Because these enhancements use Icicles completion, you must use
;;  `RET' (or `S-RET') to confirm completion.  This is one difference
;;  in completion behavior that you will notice.  The other difference
;;  is that you have all Icicles features available to you: apropos
;;  (regexp) completion, cycling of candidates, and so on.
;;
;;(@* "Dynamic Abbreviation")
;;  ** Dynamic Abbreviation **
;;
;;  Library `dabbrev.el' lets you type a few characters in a buffer
;;  and then prefix-complete them (in the same buffer) to a full word
;;  or symbol name.  The completion candidates come from words or
;;  symbol names in buffers that you are editing.  This functionality
;;  is called "dynamic abbreviation", though that is not a very good
;;  term for it (words are completed, not abbreviated, dynamically).
;;
;;  In Emacs, there are two ways to "dynamically abbreviate" text:
;;
;;  a. `M-/' (command `dabbrev-expand') completes to a candidate word.
;;     Repeating it replaces the completion with a different one -
;;     that is, it cycles candidates in the text buffer (not in the
;;     minibuffer).
;;
;;  b. `C-M-/' (command `dabbrev-completion') completes to the common
;;     root of all completion candidates.  Repeating it displays
;;     buffer *Completions* for you to choose a candidate.  However,
;;     in this case, there is no way to cycle among the candidates.
;;
;;  If there are many candidate completions, then cycling among them
;;  with `M-/' can be tedious.  You can use `C-M-/' to complete to a
;;  common root, thus narrowing the set of candidates, but then you
;;  lose the ability to cycle among them.
;;
;;  If user option `icicle-redefine-standard-commands-flag' is non-nil
;;  (which is the case by default), then Icicles redefines
;;  `dabbrev-completion' (it does not change `dabbrev-expand') so that
;;  it uses Icicles completion when you repeat `C-M-/'.  (Before
;;  repeating `C-M-/', the common root is completed as usual.)  You
;;  can then use any Icicles features, such as apropos completion and
;;  candidate cycling.
;;
;;(@* "Thesaurus Completion")
;;  ** Thesaurus Completion **
;;
;;  Library `synonyms.el' provides various features for defining a
;;  thesaurus and looking up words and phrases in it.  Command
;;  `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry' takes advantage of these
;;  features.  You can use it to complete a word in a text buffer to
;;  any word or phrase in the thesaurus.  If user option
;;  `icicle-bind-top-level-commands-flag' is non-nil (which it is by
;;  default), then this is bound to `C-c /' in Icicle mode.
;;
;;  Tip: You can use `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry' to quickly
;;  check the spelling of a word.  If it is correctly spelled, then it
;;  appears as a complete completion (is highlighted as such in the
;;  minibuffer).
;;
;;  Another Icicles command that uses the thesaurus is
;;  `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry'.  It lets you use Icicles
;;  completion, cycling, and so on to insert thesaurus words and
;;  phrases in any buffer.  It does not complete the word at point.
;;  It is a multi-command (see (@> "Multi-Commands"), above), so you
;;  can, within a single call to it, insert any number of thesaurus
;;  entries, in succession.  If you wanted to, you could write an
;;  entire book using a single call to
;;  `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry'!
;;
;;  Both commands, `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry' and
;;  `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry', require that you first load
;;  library `synonyms.el'.  See library `synonyms.el' for more
;;  information.
;;
;;(@* "Shell Command Completion")
;;  ** Shell Command Completion **
;;
;;  You can complete input to a shell or other interpreter, using your
;;  previous inputs to the interpreter as the set of completion
;;  candidates.  Just type something in the *shell* buffer, hit `C-`',
;;  and pick one or more previous inputs to execute again (this uses
;;  `icicle-search', so it is a multi-command).  You need not execute
;;  the exact same command; you can edit your previous input before
;;  entering the command.

;;(@* "Using Icicles with Delete Selection Mode")
;;  ** Using Icicles with Delete Selection Mode **
;;
;;  Icicles works especially well with Delete Selection mode, which I
;;  use and recommend.  (Likewise, for PC selection mode, which uses
;;  Delete Selection mode.)  In Delete Selection mode, whenever the
;;  region (selection) is active (highlighted), you can simply type to
;;  replace text in the region, or hit `DEL' (Backspace) or `C-d'
;;  (Delete) to delete the region.
;;
;;  However, library `delsel.el', which provides Delete Selection
;;  mode, binds keys in minibuffer maps that are also bound by
;;  Icicles.  For this reason, if you use both Icicles and Delete
;;  Selection mode, you must turn on Icicle mode after you turn on
;;  Delete Selection mode.  If you forget to do this, you will notice
;;  that `C-g' does not abort minibuffer input.  The remedy is simply
;;  to turn Icicle mode off, then on again.
;;
;;(@* "Icicles User Options and Faces")
;;  ** Icicles User Options and Faces **
;;
;;  There are several user options (variables) and faces that Icicles
;;  defines, and you can also use various standard user options,
;;  including Icomplete options, that control various aspects of
;;  completion.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-minibuffer-setup-hook' is a list of
;;    functions to be run at the end of minibuffer setup for Icicle
;;    mode.  This is nil, by default.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-update-input-hook' is a list of functions to
;;    be run when minibuffer input is updated (typing or deleting).
;;    This is nil, by default.
;;
;;  * Case sensitivity: Standard user options `completion-ignore-case'
;;    and `read-file-name-completion-ignore-case' (for Emacs 21 and
;;    later) control whether completion distinguishes between
;;    uppercase and lowercase letters.
;;
;;    In addition, you can toggle case-sensitivity at any time using
;;    `S-C-a' (that is, `C-A') in the minibuffer.  This toggles two
;;    variables, `case-fold-search' and `completion-ignore-case'.
;;    More precisely, it toggles `case-fold-search', and then it sets
;;    `completion-ignore-case' to the value of `case-fold-search'.
;;    Note that because some commands bind one or both of these
;;    variables, toggling them during command execution will not
;;    necessarily toggle the global values of both variables.
;;
;;  * Face `icicle-region-background' and user options
;;    `icicle-point-position-in-candidate',
;;    `icicle-mark-position-in-candidate', and
;;    `icicle-change-region-background-flag' are all used to define
;;    the region (the selected text) when cycling completion
;;    candidates.  They are described below individually.  The region
;;    is active when cycling, so you can easily delete it or replace
;;    it.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-point-position-in-candidate' defines the
;;    minibuffer cursor position (point) while cycling candidate
;;    completions.  By default, the cursor is placed at the end of the
;;    root being completed.  You can instead place it at the root
;;    beginning or at the beginning or end of the complete minibuffer
;;    input.  For file-name input, the beginning of minibuffer input
;;    starts after the directory name (which is inserted
;;    automatically).
;;
;;  * Similarly, user option `icicle-mark-position-in-candidate'
;;    defines the position of the mark; by default, it is at the end
;;    of the input.  Together, these two options control the size and
;;    placement of the region in a flexible way.  You can make the
;;    region include all of the input, only the root, from beginning
;;    to root, or from root to end.  You can put the cursor at either
;;    end of the region.  You can get rid of the region altogether, by
;;    making point and mark coincide (at any of the possible
;;    positions).
;;
;;  * Because the region background color is often quite different
;;    from the frame background color (in order to have it stand out),
;;    it can be a bit hard to read the completion candidates when the
;;    region is highlighted during input cycling.  If user option
;;    `icicle-change-region-background-flag' is non-nil, however, then
;;    the region background is changed to a color that differs only
;;    slightly from the frame background, making it easier to read the
;;    completion candidates.  The actual background color used is the
;;    value of `icicle-region-background', which you can customize.
;;    If you make this color the same as the frame background, then
;;    the region background is, in effect, invisible.
;;
;;  * The default value of `icicle-change-region-background-flag' is
;;    determined by the current value of `delete-selection-mode', that
;;    is, whether or not Delete Selection mode is enabled, when
;;    Icicles is loaded.  For this reason, if you use Delete Selection
;;    mode and you want the region background to change in the
;;    minibuffer, you should either turn on Delete Selection mode
;;    before loading `icicles.el' or explicitly customize
;;    `icicle-change-region-background-flag' to non-nil.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-init-value-flag' controls the treatment of a
;;    default value for minibuffer input.  This includes not only
;;    functions that read input with completion (`completing-read',
;;    `read-file-name'), but also other input-reading functions:
;;    `read-from-minibuffer' and `read-string'.  Non-nil means to
;;    automatically insert the default value into the minibuffer as an
;;    initial value.  Standard Emacs behavior is for the default value
;;    not to be inserted.  I prefer to have it inserted, as I often
;;    use the default value (perhaps editing it).  The option is nil
;;    by default only because people are not used to the (better)
;;    behavior of `insert'.  I recommend that you try `insert' for a
;;    while, before giving up on it.  If you leave this as nil,
;;    remember that you can always insert the default value manually
;;    with `M-n'.  If you do set this to a non-nil value, you can
;;    always use `M-p' to remove the default value from the
;;    minibuffer.
;;
;;  * The particular non-nil value of `icicle-init-value-flag'
;;    controls whether or not the initial value is preselected, and,
;;    if preselected, where to leave the cursor: at the beginning or
;;    end of the value.  Preselecting the value can be useful in
;;    Delete Selection mode or PC Selection mode, because it makes it
;;    easy to replace that value by typing characters, or delete it by
;;    hitting `DEL' (Backspace) or `C-d' (Delete).  However, all of
;;    the initial input is lost if you type or hit `C-d' or `DEL',
;;    which is inconvenient if you want to edit it only slightly.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-thing-at-point-functions' and
;;    `icicle-default-thing-insertion' control the behavior of `M-.'
;;    in the minibuffer, which grabs text from the current buffer and
;;    yanks it into the minibuffer.
;;    See (@> "Inserting Text Found Near the Cursor"), above, and the doc
;;    string (`C-h v') of `icicle-thing-at-point-functions' for more
;;    information.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-input-string' is a regexp string that is
;;    inserted in the minibuffer when you use `C-='.
;;    See (@> "Inserting a Regexp from a Variable"), above.
;;
;;  * Face `icicle-current-candidate-highlight' highlights the current
;;    completion candidate in buffer *Completions*.  Face
;;    `icicle-complete-input' highlights minibuffer input when it is
;;    complete.  Faces `icicle-match-highlight-minibuffer' and
;;    `icicle-match-highlight-Completions' highlight whatever your
;;    input matches, in the minibuffer and in buffer *Completions*,
;;    respectively.  Face `icicle-common-match-highlight-Completions'
;;    highlights the longest common match among all completions,
;;    provided user option `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-flag'
;;    is non-nil.
;;
;;  * Top-level command `icicle-search' uses several faces to
;;    highlight found text that matches your input.  Faces
;;    `icicle-search-main-regexp-current' and
;;    `icicle-search-main-regexp-others' highlight what your initial
;;    regexp (entered with `RET') matches.  The former highlights only
;;    the current match; the latter highlights all other matches.
;;    Face `icicle-search-current-input' highlights what your current
;;    input (typically another regexp) matches; that is, it highlights
;;    a match within the initial-regexp match.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-search-hook' is a list of functions to be
;;    run after searching and moving to an `icicle-search' match,
;;    whether you move there by `RET', `C-RET', `C-next', or
;;    `C-prior'.  See the definition of command
;;    `icicle-compilation-search' for an example of its use.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-search-highlight-threshold' controls
;;    highlighting with face `icicle-search-main-regexp-others': this
;;    many matches, maximum, are highlighted.  If zero, then only the
;;    current match is highlighted.  The effect is similar to the
;;    Emacs 22+ lazy search highlighting of `isearch' (except that the
;;    highlighting is not in fact lazy).
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag'
;;    means highlight current input match in all main search hits at
;;    once.  The default value is nil.  Setting this to non-nil can
;;    impact performance negatively, because the highlighting is
;;    updated with each input change.  You can toggle this option at
;;    any time using command `icicle-toggle-highlight-all-current',
;;    bound to `C-^' in the minibuffer (except during file-name
;;    completion).
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' means that
;;    `icicle-search' highlighting is removed after the search.  This
;;    is the default behavior.  If you set this to nil then you can
;;    remove search highlighting manually later using command
;;    `icicle-search-highlight-cleanup'.  You can toggle this search
;;    highlight removal at any time using command
;;    `icicle-toggle-search-cleanup', bound to `C-.' in the minibuffer
;;    (except during file-name completion).  One use of nil
;;    `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is to highlight regexp matches
;;    throughout a region or buffer.  In that capacity,
;;    `icicle-search' acts like some of the highlighting commands in
;;    my library `highlight.el'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-region-alist' is a list of regions, which
;;    you can act on individually or together.  The regions can be in
;;    any buffers.  As an alternative to customizing this option
;;    directly, you can use command `icicle-add-region' to add the
;;    current Emacs region to the list.  Option
;;    `icicle-regions-name-length-max' is the maximum length of the
;;    region-start string that identifies the region for completion
;;    purposes.  See (@> "Multiple Regions"), above.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-region-auto-open-files-flag' means
;;    that commands that access `icicle-region-alist' first open all
;;    of the files associated with the recorded regions.  The files
;;    are not necessarily displayed.  If this option is nil, then
;;    these commands open the files only as you access them by
;;    choosing a region candidate.  You can also open all such files
;;    at any time, using command `icicle-region-open-all-files'.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-add-buffer-name-flag' means that for
;;    some commands, such as `icicle-search' and
;;    `icicle-select-region', the name of the buffer associated with
;;    each completion candidate is added to the candidate and
;;    highlighted.  You can match against the buffer name, as well as
;;    the rest of the candidate.  Note that even when the value of
;;    this option is nil, you can use `C-M-mouse-2 and so on to see
;;    information about a candidate, and this information includes its
;;    buffer name whenever a non-nil value of the option would have
;;    shown the buffer name.  The default value is t.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-TAB-shows-candidates-flag' means
;;    that hitting `TAB' for prefix completion immediately shows the
;;    completion candidates in buffer *Completions*.  If nil,
;;    candidates are shown only after `TAB' is hit a second time,
;;    which is the standard Emacs behavior.  The default value is t.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag' controls
;;    whether or not buffer *Completions* is shown initially, without
;;    your needing to hit `TAB' or `S-TAB' to show it.  However, if
;;    you type something before `icicle-incremental-completion-delay',
;;    then display is inhibited.  The default value is nil, meaning
;;    that *Completions* is not shown until you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB'.
;;    More typical than setting this option to non-nil globally is to
;;    bind it to non-nil in Emacs-Lisp code, to display *Completions*
;;    as a menu.  For example, pass a non-nil binding to
;;    `icicle-define-command' to create a command that displays a
;;    multiple-choice menu.  As an alternative to a non-nil
;;    `icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag', you can set option
;;    `icicle-incremental-completion-flag' to a value that is neither
;;    nil nor t; that will display *Completions* as soon as you type
;;    or delete input (but not initially).
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-incremental-completion-flag' controls
;;    whether or not *Completions* is updated incrementally
;;    (icompletion) as you type.  You can toggle incremental
;;    completion at any time using `C-#'.  For more information, see
;;    (@> "Icompletion"), above.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-incremental-completion-delay' and
;;    `icicle-incremental-completion-threshold' together cause a delay
;;    before incremental completion takes effect.
;;    See (@> "Icompletion"), above.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-Completions-display-min-input-chars' is the
;;    minimum number of input characters that allow buffer
;;    *Completions* to remain displayed.  By default, this is zero
;;    (0), meaning that any number of input characters, even none,
;;    allows *Completions* to remain displayed.  If you use
;;    incremental completion (see `icicle-incremental-completion-*'),
;;    and you are bothered by *Completions* being automatically
;;    updated when, for instance, you empty the minibuffer, then you
;;    might want to set this option to, say, 1 or 2.  With a value of
;;    2, for instance, whenever the minibuffer input has less than 2
;;    characters, incremental completion will remove the *Completions*
;;    window.  You can also remove the *Completions* window at any
;;    time using `icicle-remove-Completions-window', which is bound to
;;    `C-x 0' in the minibuffer.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-Completions-frame-at-right-flag' controls
;;    whether `icicle-candidate-action' moves the frame showing buffer
;;    *Completions* to the right, out of the way of other frames.
;;    This can be useful if you use one-buffer-per-frame (non-nil
;;    `pop-up-frames').  In that case, I recommend that you also try
;;    my library `oneonone.el'.
;;    See (@> "Note on Non-Nil `pop-up-frames' on MS Windows"), below, for
;;    more advice about non-nil `pop-up-frames'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-Completions-window-default-width' is the
;;    default width of the *Completions* window.  This has no effect
;;    if *Completions* is already displayed or it will be displayed in
;;    an existing window.  It also has no effect if *Completions* is a
;;    special buffer, so it will be displayed in its own frame.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-Completions-window-max-height' is the
;;    maximum height of the *Completions* window, in lines.  The
;;    window is fit to the buffer size, with this as maximum height.
;;    This is not used if *Completions* is a special buffer with its
;;    own frame, and it is not used in Emacs releases prior to 21.
;;
;;  * Face `icicle-historical-candidate' is used to highlight
;;    completion candidates that you have used (entered with `RET')
;;    previously.  This highlighting is controlled by user option
;;    `icicle-highlight-historical-candidates-flag'.  You can toggle
;;    this option from the minibuffer at any time using `C-pause'.
;;    See (@> "History Enhancements"), above.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-sort-function' controls the order of
;;    completion candidates during cycling and in buffer
;;    *Completions*.  If nil, then no sorting is done.  If non-nil,
;;    then the value must be a string-comparison function - the
;;    function is passed to the standard function `sort' to do the
;;    sorting.  The default value for `icicle-sort-function' is
;;    `icicle-case-string-less-p', which sorts alphabetically,
;;    possibly ignoring letter case.  During completion, you can
;;    toggle sorting using `C-,'.  If you are an Emacs-Lisp programmer
;;    and you write new commands using Icicles functionalities, you
;;    can bind `icicle-sort-function' temporarily to any sort function
;;    you need.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-alternative-sort-function' is an alternative
;;    to `icicle-sort-function, providing a different sort order.  By
;;    default, it is `icicle-historical-alphabetic-p', a function that
;;    sorts previously used completion candidates before candidates
;;    that have not yet been used, and sorts alphabetically within
;;    each of these groups of candidates.  In other words, it places
;;    inputs that you have used previously at the top of buffer
;;    *Completions* and makes them available for completion first.
;;    During completion, you can toggle normal and alternative sorting
;;    using `C-M-,'.  See (@> "Sorting Candidates") and
;;    (@> "History Enhancements"), above.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-change-sort-order-completion-flag' specifies
;;    whether `C-,' cycles among available sort orders or lets you
;;    choose a sort order using Icicles completion.  Non-nil means to
;;    use completion; nil (the default value) means to cycle.  You can
;;    override the current setting at any time by using `C-u C-,'.
;;    See (@> "Sorting Candidates"), above.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-sort-functions-alist' is an alist of
;;    possible sort orders for user to choose from using `C-,' or
;;    `M-,'.  See (@> "Sorting Candidates"), above.
;;
;;  * The value of user option `icicle-transform-function' is a
;;    function that is applied to the list of completion candidates,
;;    to transform them before they are presented to the user.  If
;;    nil, then no transformation is done.  The default transformation
;;    is to remove duplicate candidates, when transformation is
;;    active, but the default value of this option is nil.  You can
;;    toggle transformation at any time using command
;;    `icicle-toggle-transforming', bound to `C-$' in the minibuffer.
;;    Although this is a user option, you probably do *NOT* want to
;;    change its value.  Icicles commands already "do the right thing"
;;    when it comes to candidate transformation.  The value of this
;;    option may be changed by program locally, for use in particular
;;    contexts.  For example, when you use `icicle-search-generic'
;;    (`C-`') in a *shell* buffer, Icicles uses this variable with a
;;    value of `icicle-remove-duplicates', to remove duplicate shell
;;    commands from your input history list.  Lisp programmers can use
;;    this variable to transform the list of candidates in any way
;;    they like.  A typical use is to remove duplicates, by binding it
;;    to `icicle-remove-duplicates'.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-require-match-flag' and
;;    `icicle-buffer-require-match-flag' let you override the value of
;;    the REQUIRE-MATCH argument provided to `completing-read' or
;;    `read-file-name'.  They are provided mainly for use (binding) in
;;    `icicle-define-command' and `icicle-define-file-command', but
;;    you may also use them globally, if you wish.
;;    See (@> "Exiting the Minibuffer Without Confirmation: `S-RET'"),
;;    above.
;;
;;    A typical use is made in the definition of command
;;    `icicle-buffer': `icicle-buffer-require-match-flag' is used to
;;    bind `icicle-require-match-flag', so that you can, for example,
;;    match only existing buffers and be able to match on partial
;;    input without explicitly completing (hitting `TAB' or `S-TAB').
;;    Simply set the option to `partial-match-ok' to get this
;;    behavior.  To apropos-complete and exit the minibuffer, use
;;    `S-RET' instead of `RET'.
;;    See (@> "Exiting the Minibuffer Without Confirmation: `S-RET'"),
;;    above, for more information.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-ignore-space-prefix-flag' means to
;;    ignore completion candidates that start with a space.  However,
;;    such candidates are not ignored for prefix completion if the
;;    input also starts with a space.  Naturally, apropos completion
;;    is not affected by whether or not the input starts with a space.
;;
;;    Option `icicle-buffer-ignore-space-prefix-flag' lets you
;;    override the value of `icicle-ignore-space-prefix-flag' for use
;;    with buffer-name completion (the names of internal buffers start
;;    with a space).  It is provided mainly for binding in
;;    `icicle-define-command' (`icicle-buffer' does this).
;;
;;    You can toggle `icicle-ignore-space-prefix-flag' at any time
;;    using `C-^' in the minibuffer.  If the current command binds
;;    this option locally, then it is the local, not the global, value
;;    that is changed.  For example, if
;;    `icicle-buffer-ignore-space-prefix-flag' is non-nil, then `C-^'
;;    toggles `icicle-ignore-space-prefix-flag' to nil only for the
;;    duration of `icicle-buffer'.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-regexp-quote-flag' reduces apropos
;;    completion to simple substring completion.  Regexp special
;;    characters are no longer recognized as special in this case;
;;    they simply match themselves.  You probably do not want to
;;    customize this option.  Instead, you can toggle it at any time
;;    using `C-`' in the minibuffer.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-redefine-standard-commands-flag' controls
;;    whether Icicles redefines some standard commands, enhancing them
;;    to use Icicles completion.  A non-nil value causes redefinition.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-buffer-match-regexp',
;;    `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp', `icicle-buffer-predicate', and
;;    `icicle-buffer-extras' determine the behavior of commands
;;    `icicle-buffer' and `icicle-buffer-other-window'.  They
;;    determine the set of buffer-name candidates initially available
;;    for completion.  The first three restrict this set to names that
;;    satisfy the properties they specify.  Option
;;    `icicle-buffer-extras' lets you add additional buffer names to
;;    the set of candidates, after restriction by the other options.
;;    Since these are user options, they provide an additional, more
;;    static way to filter the set of candidates.  Typing input
;;    (e.g. a regexp) then dynamically filters the result of applying
;;    the filter options.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-buffer-sort' is a predicate used to sort
;;    buffer-name candidates in commands `icicle-buffer' and
;;    `icicle-buffer-other-window'.  One possible value is
;;    `icicle-buffer-sort-*...*-last', which sorts names of internal
;;    buffers, which begin with `*', after other buffer names.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-buffer-configs' is a list of named
;;    configurations of options `icicle-buffer-match-regexp',
;;    `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp', `icicle-buffer-predicate',
;;    `icicle-buffer-extras', and `icicle-buffer-sort'.  You use
;;    command `icicle-buffer-config' to choose one of the
;;    configurations to be current.  You can use commands
;;    `icicle-add-buffer-config' and `icicle-remove-buffer-config' to
;;    add and remove configurations from the list.
;;
;;    Example: A configuration such as the following, named "Files and
;;    Scratch", defines `icicle-buffer-predicate' to display only file
;;    buffers, and it defines `icicle-buffer-extras' to include the
;;    extra buffer `*scratch*':
;;
;;     ("Files and Scratch" nil nil
;;      (lambda (bufname) (buffer-file-name (get-buffer bufname)))
;;      ("*scratch*") icicle-sort-function)
;;
;;    The idea of buffer-option configurations was borrowed from
;;    library `bs.el', by Olaf Sylvester <olaf@geekware.de>.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-list-join-string',
;;    `icicle-list-end-string', and
;;    `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string' are described in
;;    "Multi-Completions", above, and "Programming Multi-Completions",
;;    below.  Option `icicle-list-join-string' is the separator string
;;    that joins together the parts of a multi-completion.  The end
;;    string is appended to each multi-completion candidate.  Option
;;    `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string' specifies how the
;;    multi-completion extracted parts are joined back together when a
;;    user chooses a multi-completion.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-kmacro-ring-max' acts as `kmacro-ring-max'
;;    when you are in Icicle mode.  (When you exit Icicle mode,
;;    `kmacro-ring-max' is restored.)  In Icicles, you will typically
;;    want to use a much larger number than the default value in
;;    vanilla Emacs.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-regexp-search-ring-max' and
;;    `icicle-search-ring-max' act as `regexp-search-ring-max' and
;;    `search-ring-max', respectively, when you are in Icicle mode.
;;    (When you exit Icicle mode, `regexp-search-ring-max' and
;;    `search-ring-max' are restored.)  The reason for having these
;;    options is that with Icicles you will likely want to use a much
;;    longer search history.  By default, these are as large as
;;    possible (virtually unlimited).
;;
;;    Suggestion: If you use library `savehist.el' (recommended),
;;    customize `savehist-additional-variables' to include variables
;;    `search-ring' and `regexp-search-ring', so that your search
;;    histories will be saved between Emacs sessions.
;;
;;    Note: You can clear (empty) a given search history with command
;;    `icicle-clear-option'.  For example, to clear the
;;    regular-expression search history, do this:
;;
;;      `C-u M-x icicle-clear-option RET regexp-search-ring RET'
;;
;;    (The `C-u' is needed because this variable is not a user
;;    option.)  If you use my library `misc-cmds.el', you can clear
;;    search histories easier, using commands `clear-search-history',
;;    `clear-regexp-search-history', and `clear-search-histories'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-completing-prompt-prefix' is a string
;;    prepended to the prompt during completion, to help you see that
;;    completion is possible.  The face of the same name is used to
;;    highlight this prefix.  User option and face
;;    `icicle-completing-mustmatch-prompt-prefix' are similar, but
;;    they apply to completion when the input must match a candidate.
;;    These options and faces are not used for versions of Emacs
;;    before Emacs 21.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-reminder-prompt-flag' controls the addition
;;    of a reminder about Icicles bindings to the minibuffer prompt.
;;    This is the reminder: "(<S-tab>, TAB: list, C-?: help)".  If
;;    this is nil or 0, the reminder is never displayed.  If this is
;;    t, the reminder is always displayed.  If this is a whole number,
;;    the reminder is displayed for that many Emacs sessions; it is
;;    not displayed thereafter.  The default value is 7, meaning that
;;    you see the reminder during 7 Emacs sessions.  Regardless of the
;;    value of this option, the reminder only appears when there is
;;    sufficient minibuffer space.  The reminder is highlighted in
;;    face `icicle-prompt-suffix'.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-touche-pas-aux-menus-flag' means
;;    that Icicles will not add menu items to menu-bar menus, except
;;    for the Icicles and Minibuf menus.  Default value nil means that
;;    whenever an appropriate menu-bar menu exists, Icicles items are
;;    added to it.  For example, if nil, then Delete File is added to
;;    the File menu; otherwise it is added to the Icicles menu.  The
;;    value of this option is used only when Icicle mode is initially
;;    established, so changing it has no effect after Icicles has been
;;    loaded.  However, you can change it and save the new value, so
;;    it will be used next time.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-flag'
;;    means that completion commands `TAB' and `S-TAB' expand your
;;    minibuffer input to the longest common match among all
;;    completion candidates.  This replaces the input you typed,
;;    completing it as far as possible.  If you want to edit your
;;    original, raw input, use `C-l'.  If your input has been
;;    expanded, then hit `C-l' twice: once to replace a completion
;;    candidate (from, say, `next') with the common match string, and
;;    a second time to replace the common match string with your
;;    original input.  The main reason you might want to set this to
;;    nil is for apropos completion, if you want to always work with a
;;    regexp in the minibuffer.
;;    See (@> "Longest-Common-Match Completion"), above.
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-cycling-respects-completion-mode-flag'
;;    causes the modal cycling keys (`up' and `down', by default, but
;;    configurable by `icicle-modal-cycle-up-key' and
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-key') to act differently during
;;    completion, depending on whether you precede their use by `TAB'
;;    or `S-TAB'.  In other words, when this option is non-nil, the
;;    current completion mode determines the behavior of the modal
;;    cycling keys.  The default behavior of these keys if this option
;;    is non-nil is to traverse the input history.  After `TAB',
;;    however, they cycle prefix completions, and after `S-TAB', they
;;    cycle apropos completions.
;;
;;    If this option is non-nil you can still use `M-p' and `M-n' to
;;    traverse the input history, `C-p' and `C-n' to cycle prefix
;;    completions, and `prior' and `next' to cycle apropos completions
;;    (unless you use one or more of those keys also as modal cycling
;;    keys).  If you do that, you need not use `TAB' and `S-TAB' to
;;    switch between the two completion types.  Once you have used
;;    `TAB' or `S-TAB', the only way to traverse the history is via
;;    `M-p' and `M-n'.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-modal-cycle-up-key' and
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-key' are the keys used for modal
;;    cycling.  By default, these are [up] and [down].  These options
;;    have an effect only if option
;;    `icicle-cycling-respects-completion-mode-flag' is non-nil.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-word-completion-key' is the key to use for
;;    word completion.  By default, this is `M-SPC'.
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-highlight-input-initial-whitespace-flag'
;;    uses face `icicle-whitespace-highlight' to highlight any
;;    whitespace that starts your minibuffer input.  This is done to
;;    help you recognize accidentally typing such whitespace.
;;    Otherwise, you might not understand the set of matching
;;    completion candidates (or lack thereof).  There is not
;;    necessarily anything wrong with input that starts with
;;    whitespace - it might be what you want, but without this
;;    highlighting it is easy to not notice the whitespace.
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-bind-top-level-commands-flag' binds
;;    several top-level Icicles commands when you are in Icicle mode.
;;    For example, it substitutes `icicle-kill-buffer' for
;;    `kill-buffer' (binding it to whatever `kill-buffer' is bound to
;;    globally).  Top-level commands are commands that are not used
;;    only in the minibuffer.
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-show-Completions-help-flag' means display
;;    help (instructions) at the top of the *Completions* window.
;;    These instructions are shown in faces
;;    `icicle-Completions-instruction-1' and
;;    `icicle-Completions-instruction-2'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-color-themes' is a list of color themes to
;;    cycle through when you use command `icicle-color-theme'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-saved-completion-sets' is a persistent list
;;    of named sets of completion candidates.  You can switch among
;;    such sets at any time.
;;    See (@> "Persistent Sets of Completion Candidates"), above.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-key-descriptions-use-<>-flag' determines
;;    whether angle brackets (`<', `>') are used by Icicles for named
;;    keys, such as function keys (`<f9>' vs `f9') and pseudo keys
;;    (`<mode-line>' vs `mode-line').  Non-nil means to use angle
;;    brackets.  This option does not affect Emacs key descriptions
;;    outside of Icicles (e.g. `C-h k' or `C-h w'), and it has no
;;    effect for versions of Emacs prior to 21, because they never use
;;    angle brackets.  The default value is nil, because I think angle
;;    brackets reduce readability.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-keymaps-for-key-completion' is a list of
;;    variables that are bound to keymaps in which you want to bind
;;    `S-TAB' to `icicle-complete-keys'.  Each such keymap should have
;;    at least one prefix key.  `S-TAB' is bound in each keymap, so
;;    that you can use it to complete the prefix keys.
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-complete-keys-self-insert-flag' means
;;    `icicle-complete-keys' includes self-inserting keys as
;;    completion candidates.  You will probably want to leave this nil
;;    and use command `icicle-insert-char', not
;;    `icicle-complete-keys', to insert special characters.
 
;;(@* "File-Name and Directory-Name Completion Tips")
;;
;;  File-Name and Directory-Name Completion Tips
;;  --------------------------------------------
;;
;;  This section contains some tips on completing file and directory
;;  names.  See also (@> "Customization and General Tips"), above, for
;;  general tips about using Icicles.  Many of those tips apply also
;;  to file-name and directory-name completion.
;;
;;  * Function `icicle-dirs-last-p' is provided as a possible value
;;    for user option `icicle-sort-function'.  It treats file and
;;    directory names specially, sorting directory names after file
;;    names; otherwise, it is the same as `icicle-case-string-less-p'.
;;    (You can of course reach directory names before, instead of
;;    after, file names, by using `up' and `prior' instead of `down'
;;    and `next'.)
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-cycle-into-subdirs-flag' controls whether or
;;    not minibuffer-input cycling explores subdirectories.  By
;;    default, it is nil, meaning that cycling does not descend into
;;    subdirectories.
;;
;;    non-nil - When this option is non-nil, you might want to use a
;;          function such as `icicle-dirs-last-p' for option
;;          `icicle-sort-function', to prevent cycling depth first
;;          into the subdirectories.
;;
;;    nil - When this option is nil, you can still choose to cycle
;;          into a given directory (which is why nil is the default
;;          value).  When cycling reaches a candidate directory that
;;          you want to cycle through, just: 1) move the cursor
;;          (e.g. `C-e'), 2) hit `TAB' or `S-TAB' to "complete" the
;;          candidate, and then 3) use any of the cycle keys, such as
;;          `up', to cycle within the candidate directory.
;;
;;          Although the candidate directory was already completed by
;;          cycling, moving the cursor and explicitly "completing" it
;;          tells Icicles that you want to treat the candidate in the
;;          minibuffer as real input, just as if you had typed it, not
;;          merely as a cycling candidate.
;;
;;  * You can use `..' during completion to access a parent directory,
;;    and you can use `/' and `~/' to shadow input to the left.  There
;;    is currently no special treatment of MS Windows drive letters
;;    (e.g. `C:') - I use Cygwin on Windows.
;;
;;  * Standard user option `completion-ignored-extensions' controls
;;    which file names are ignored for completion and completion
;;    cycling.  You can toggle this ignoring at any time using command
;;    `icicle-toggle-ignored-extensions', bound to `C-.' in the
;;    minibuffer during file-name completion.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-use-~-for-home-dir-flag' controls whether
;;    your home directory is written in the minibuffer using `~' or in
;;    expanded form, during completion.  The default value is `t',
;;    which means to use `~', saving minibuffer space.  You can toggle
;;    this option at any time using command
;;    `icicle-toggle-~-for-home-dir', bound to `M-~'.
;;
;;  * Remember that you can use a regular expression to
;;    apropos-complete file names.  This is a powerful feature.  Do
;;    not confuse its use with the ability to use shell wildcards to
;;    access multiple files at once.  For example, if you use `C-x 4 f
;;    *.el RET', then all files with suffix `el' will be opened.
;;    Regexp matching is used only for apropos (not prefix) completion
;;    and cycling.  See (@> "What About Special-Character Conflicts?"),
;;    above.
;;
;;  * You can use `$' for both environment variables and as a regexp
;;    special character.  For example, you can use a pattern such as
;;    `$HOME.*t$' to match the files in your home directory (`$HOME')
;;    whose names end in `t'.
;;    See (@> "What About Special-Character Conflicts?"), above.
;;
;;  * You can use the idiom `\W$' as input to match only directories,
;;    when a command asks for a file or directory name.  The `\W' says
;;    to match any non word-syntax character.  The `$' says to match
;;    this at the end of the name.  This works because directory names
;;    appear as completion candidates with a trailing slash (`/'), and
;;    slash (`/') is about the only non word-syntax character that is
;;    likely to appear in file-name completions.
;;    See (@> "What About Special-Character Conflicts?"), above.
;;
;;  * You can use library `ffap.el', if you like, with Icicles, to
;;    pick up the file, directory, or URL name under the cursor.  All
;;    Icicles features are available during file-name and URL
;;    completion.  If you like `ffap.el', you might also like to try
;;    my extension library `ffap-.el'.
;;    See also (@> "Inserting Text Found Near the Cursor"), above.
;;
;;  * Most Icicles commands that target file or directory names look
;;    only in the current directory (`default-directory').  This means
;;    that the directory part of the name is ignored for matching
;;    purposes.  You can thus use apropos completion to match a
;;    substring, without needing to prefix the substring with `.*'.
;;    For example, to match file `favorite-foo-file.bar' in directory
;;    `/some/path/to/my/', it is sufficient to use either `foo' or
;;    `/some/path/to/my/foo'.
;;
;;  * Some Icicles commands that target file names match your input
;;    against absolute file-name completion candidates.  This is the
;;    case for `icicle-recent-file', `icicle-locate-file', and
;;    `icicle-locate-file-other-window'.  These commands let you
;;    regexp-match against any part of the absolute file name,
;;    including directory components.
;;    See (@> "File-Name Input and Locating Files Anywhere"), above.
 
;;(@* "Key Bindings")
;;
;;  Key Bindings
;;  ------------
;;
;;(@* "Global Bindings")
;;  ** Global Bindings **
;;
;;  Icicles does not change your global key bindings.  It changes some
;;  minibuffer bindings, and it adds some bindings for Icicle mode,
;;  but it does not change your global bindings.
;;
;;  There are two exceptions:
;;
;;  1. In Icicle mode, various Icicles commands are added to menu-bar
;;  menus.  File commands are added to the File menu, and so on.
;;  Those that do not belong naturally to any existing menu-bar menu
;;  are added to a new Icicles menu and to existing menu Minibuf.
;;  Whatever the menu they appear in, however, Icicles menu items are
;;  enabled only when Icicle mode is active.  Those that are in a menu
;;  other than the Icicles menu have "[Icy]" prefixed to their name so
;;  you can easily identify them.
;;
;;  If you do not want Icicles to add items to menus besides Minibuf
;;  and Icicles, then set option `icicle-touche-pas-aux-menus' to
;;  non-nil.  See (@> "Customizing Key Bindings"), below.
;;
;;  2. Icicles adds the key `S-TAB' (bound to `icicle-complete-keys')
;;  to each existing keymap.  This allows you to complete keys in any
;;  keymap.  For technical reasons, these bindings are not part of
;;  `icicle-mode-map'; other keymaps are enhanced to include this
;;  binding.  However, this Icicles binding of `S-TAB' never replaces
;;  any existing binding of `S-TAB'.  See (@> "Key Completion"),
;;  above, for more information about this use of `S-TAB'.
;;
;;(@* "Icicles-Mode Bindings")
;;  ** Icicles-Mode Bindings **
;;
;;  Most Icicle-mode bindings are in the Icicles menubar menu.  If
;;  user option `icicle-bind-top-level-commands-flag' is non-nil
;;  (which it is by default), then additional, non-menu bindings are
;;  made in Icicle mode.  Some of these take the place of similar,
;;  global bindings when you are in Icicle mode.  Typically, the
;;  Icicles commands are multi-command versions of the vanilla Emacs
;;  commands (see "Multi-Commands", above).
;;
;;  Icicles makes the following Icicle-mode bindings, in addition to
;;  Icicles-menu bindings, when `icicle-bind-top-level-commands-flag'
;;  is non-nil:
;;
;;  * `C-c ''          - `icicle-occur'
;;  * `C-c `'          - `icicle-search'
;;  * `C-c `'          - `icicle-comint-search' (in *shell* etc.)
;;  * `C-c TAB'        - `icicle-comint-command' (in *shell* etc.)
;;  * `C-c `'          - `icicle-compilation-search' (in *grep* etc.)
;;  * `C-c /'          - `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry'
;;  * `ESC M-x', `M-`' - `icicle-execute-menu-command'
;;  * `C-x M-e'        - `icicle-execute-named-keyboard-macro'
;;  * `f5'             - `icicle-kmacro'
;;  * `pause'          - `icicle-switch-to/from-minibuffer'
;;
;;  `S-TAB' is bound, in effect, to `icicle-complete-keys', which
;;  completes a key sequence.  Prefix keys followed by `S-TAB' are
;;  also bound to `icicle-complete-keys'.  (`S-TAB' is effectively
;;  bound to other commands in buffer *Completions* and in the
;;  minibuffer.)
;;
;;  Icicles also substitutes all of the key bindings for some standard
;;  commands.  For example, instead of binding `icicle-buffer' to `C-x
;;  b' in Icicle mode, Icicles binds `icicle-buffer' to all keys that
;;  are globally bound to standard command `switch-to-buffer'.  The
;;  following standard commands have their bindings co-opted this way
;;  by Icicles commands:
;;
;;  Standard Command                   Icicles Command
;;
;;  `abort-recursive-edit'.............`icicle-abort-minibuffer-input'
;;  `exchange-point-and-mark'.........`icicle-exchange-point-and-mark'

;;(@* "Minibuffer Bindings")
;;  ** Minibuffer Bindings **
;;
;;  There are many key bindings available during completion.  Most of
;;  these key sequences are bound in the minibuffer completion
;;  keymaps, but some are bound in the *Completions* buffer keymap.
;;  In addition, clicking `mouse-3' on a completion in buffer
;;  *Completions* pops up a menu of available commands.
;;
;;  Some of these menu commands are applicable to the completion you
;;  click; others apply to the current state of completion or to the
;;  complete set of completion candidates.  The associated key
;;  bindings are indicated in the menu items, so this can be a good
;;  way to learn minibuffer and *Completions* bindings.
;;
;;  The following key bindings are made for the minibuffer completion
;;  keymaps.  They are in effect whenever you are using the minibuffer
;;  for input with completion (e.g. `completing-read',
;;  `read-file-name', `M-x').
;;
;;    `C-?' is bound to `icicle-completion-help': Pop up a *Help*
;;    buffer with information on using Icicles completion.  This
;;    includes information on key bindings during completion similar
;;    to what you are reading now.
;;
;;    Keys bound globally to `next-line' and `previous-line' are bound
;;    to `icicle-next-prefix-candidate' and
;;    `icicle-previous-prefix-candidate'.  Those are the commands
;;    that cycle candidate prefix completions.  By default, this means
;;    keys `down', `up', `C-n', and `C-p'.
;;
;;    Keys bound globally to `scroll-up' and `scroll-down' are bound
;;    to `icicle-next-apropos-candidate' and
;;    `icicle-previous-apropos-candidate'.  Those are the commands
;;    that cycle candidate apropos completions.  By default, this
;;    means keys `next', `prior', `C-v', and `M-v'.
;;
;;    Keys bound globally to commands that perform simple text
;;    insertion, deletion, and transposition operations - commands
;;    such as `self-insert-command' - are bound to Icicles versions of
;;    those commands that do the same thing but also provide apropos
;;    icompletion.  This includes keys such as `C-d', `M-d', `C-y',
;;    `C-k', and `C-w' (and lots more).  See (@> "Icompletion"),
;;    above.
;;
;;    `pause'  - `icicle-switch-to/from-minibuffer': Move cursor to
;;               the buffer from which the minibuffer was activated.
;;
;;    `insert' - `icicle-switch-to-Completions-buf': Move cursor to
;;               the current candidate in buffer *Completions*.
;;
;;    `M-q'    - `icicle-insert-key-description': Insert the textual
;;               representation of a key sequence (used for key
;;               completion).
;;
;;    `SPC'    - `icicle-self-insert' (see above): Insert a space.
;;
;;    `M-SPC'  - `icicle-prefix-word-complete': Complete current input
;;               in minibuffer, as a prefix, a single word at a time.
;;               This replaces `minibuffer-complete-word'.  In fact,
;;               it is the value of `icicle-word-completion-key' that
;;               is bound to this command; `M-SPC' is the default
;;               value of this user option.
;;
;;    `TAB'    - `icicle-prefix-complete': Complete current input in
;;               minibuffer, as a prefix.  If there is more than one
;;               prefix-completion candidate, display them in buffer
;;               *Completions*, highlighting the common prefix.  This
;;               replaces `minibuffer-complete'.
;;
;;    `S-TAB'  - `icicle-apropos-complete': Like `TAB', but use
;;               apropos completion.
;;
;;    `delete' - `icicle-remove-candidate': Remove the current
;;               candidate from consideration.
;;
;;    `S-mouse-2' - Same as `delete'
;;
;;  If you prefer, you can use the keys that are the values of options
;;  `icicle-modal-cycle-up-key' and `icicle-modal-cycle-down-key'
;;  (`up' and `down', by default) for both prefix and apropos
;;  completion, as well as for input-history traversal - the behavior
;;  is determined by whether you have previously used `TAB' or
;;  `S-TAB'.  To obtain this modal behavior, set user option
;;  `icicle-cycling-respects-completion-mode-flag' to non-nil.  The
;;  documentation here assumes the default value of nil.  See
;;  (@> "Customization and General Tips"), above.
;;
;;  The following minibuffer bindings are made to clear minibuffer
;;  input, making them handy for editing and removing completions
;;  (e.g. default or initial values) in the minibuffer.
;;
;;    `M-k' - `icicle-erase-minibuffer-or-history-element'
;;    `M-S-backspace', `M-S-delete' - `icicle-erase-minibuffer'
;;
;;  `M-k' has an alternative behavior when you are cycling minibuffer
;;  history items: it deletes the current item from the history.
;;
;;  The following minibuffer binding can be used to get rid of a
;;  completion inserted during cycling, and retrieve the last real
;;  input:
;;
;;    `C-l' - `icicle-retrieve-last-input'
;;
;;  `C-l' also has another important use: You can use it to retrieve
;;  your last input in case you never actually entered that input (via
;;  `RET').  For example, suppose that you used `C-h v hook' to
;;  examine various hook variables, and you did this using`C-next' to
;;  display their documentation.  If you finished the command by just
;;  typing `C-g', then your input (`hook') was never really entered,
;;  so it is not available via the minibuffer history (`M-p').  You
;;  can retrieve it with `C-l', to use it again, in your next command.
;;
;;  You of course have the standard access to the minibuffer history,
;;  via `M-p', `M-n', `M-r', and `M-s'.  In addition to these, the
;;  following minibuffer bindings let you use apropos completion on
;;  the current minibuffer history list.  For explanation, see

;;  for individual candidates.  An alternative action is specific to

;;
;;    `S-C-RET'     - `icicle-candidate-alt-action': current candidate

;;(@* "Customizing Key Bindings")
;;
;;  Customizing Key Bindings
;;  ------------------------
;;
;;  See (@> "Key Bindings"), above, for a description of the key bindings
;;  defined by Icicles.
;;
;;  Key bindings are very personal choices, and reflect preferences
;;  and habits, as well as keyboard and other configurations.  You
;;  might want to change some of the bindings that Icicles creates.
;;  This section tells you how to do that.
;;
;;  However, before doing so, unless the default bindings present a
;;  hardware or OS configuration problem for you, please try using the
;;  default bindings for a while, before deciding that you want to
;;  change them.  Habit is a powerful persuader, but its advice is not
;;  always the best ;-).
;;
;;  There are two kinds of Icicles bindings:
;;
;;  * Additions to menu-bar menus
;;  * Minibuffer bindings
;;
;;(@* "Customizing Menu-Bar Menus")
;;  ** Customizing Menu-Bar Menus **
;;
;;  Icicles normally adds items to appropriate existing menu-bar
;;  menus, such as File and Options, as well as to menu-bar menus
;;  Minibuf and Icicles, but you can prevent this, if you like.  If
;;  you do not want to add items to menus besides Minibuf and Icicles,
;;  then just set option `icicle-touche-pas-aux-menus-flag' to non-nil
;;  before loading Icicles.  The items in question are then added to
;;  the Icicles menu instead.
;;
;;(@* "Customizing Minibuffer Bindings")
;;  ** Customizing Minibuffer Bindings **
;;
;;  Note: If you are thinking about customizing key bindings just so
;;  that you can use `up' and `down' for the minibuffer history,
;;  consider setting `icicle-cycling-respects-completion-mode-flag' to
;;  t instead; it should give you the behavior you want.  If you still
;;  want to customize keys to do this, then see the example below.
;;
;;  To understand how you can modify Icicles minibuffer bindings, it
;;  helps to know how Icicles creates the default bindings.  For that,
;;  the best advice is to consult the Emacs-Lisp code in library
;;  `icicle-fn.el'.
;;
;;  Even if you are not very familiar with Emacs-Lisp, however, you
;;  should be able to do what you want by adapting the example in this
;;  section.
;;
;;  Suppose that you use `up', `down', `C-p', and `C-n' outside of
;;  Emacs to traverse history lists.  This is a common feature of
;;  various shells, for instance.  And suppose you want to use these
;;  keys similarly within Emacs.  Suppose that you decide to replace
;;  the Icicles minibuffer bindings for these keys with bindings to
;;  the history-traversal commands, and replace the history-traversal
;;  bindings of Icicles, `M-p' and `M-n', with bindings to the Icicles
;;  commands that are bound by default to `up', `down', `C-p', and
;;  `C-n'.  That is, suppose that you want to remap:
;;
;;    `previous-history-element'         to `up' and `C-p'
;;    `next-history-element'             to `down' and `C-n'
;;    `icicle-previous-prefix-candidate' to `M-p'
;;    `icicle-next-prefix-candidate'     to `M-n'
;;
;;  You can do that by inserting code such as the following into your
;;  init file (~/.emacs), before the code that requires (loads)
;;  library `icicles.el':
;;
;;  (add-hook 'icicle-mode-hook 'bind-my-icicles-keys)
;;  (defun bind-my-icicles-keys ()
;;    "Replace some default Icicles bindings with others I prefer."
;;    (dolist
;;        (map
;;          (append
;;           (list minibuffer-local-completion-map
;;                 minibuffer-local-must-match-map)
;;           (and (fboundp
;;                 'minibuffer-local-filename-completion-map)
;;                (list minibuffer-local-filename-completion-map))))
;;      (when icicle-mode
;;        (icicle-remap 'previous-line 'previous-history-element map)
;;        (icicle-remap 'next-line 'next-history-element map)
;;        (define-key map [?\M-p] 'icicle-previous-prefix-candidate)
;;        (define-key map [?\M-n] 'icicle-next-prefix-candidate))))
;;
;;  In the `global-map', command `next-line' is bound to `down' and
;;  `C-n'.  Icicles uses function `icicle-remap' to remap `next-line'
;;  to `icicle-next-prefix-candidate'.  Your `bind-my-icicles-keys'
;;  code then remaps it to `next-history-element'.  Likewise for
;;  `previous-line'.  Icicles does not change the standard Emacs
;;  minibuffer bindings for `M-p' and `M-n', so they are still
;;  `previous-history-element' and `next-history-element'.  You can
;;  just use `define-key' to change the bindings of `M-p' and `M-n'.
;;
;;  See also (@> "Customization and General Tips"), above, for information
;;  on other customizations, besides key bindings.

;;
;;  Icicles Redefines Some Standard Commands
;;  ----------------------------------------
;;
;;  If user option `icicle-redefine-standard-commands-flag' is
;;  non-nil, then Icicles automatically redefines a few standard Emacs
;;  commands when you are in Icicle mode, enhancing them for Icicles
;;  completion:
;;
;;    `customize-apropos', `customize-apropos-faces',
;;    `customize-apropos-groups', `customize-apropos-options',
;;    `dabbrev-completion', `digit-argument' (in minibuffer),

;;    `minibuffer-complete-and-exit', `mouse-choose-completion',
;;    `negative-argument' (in minibuffer), `repeat-complex-command',
;;    `switch-to-completions', `universal-argument' (in minibuffer),
;;    `yank' (in minibuffer), `yank-pop' (in minibuffer).
;;
;;  When you exit Icicle mode, the pre-Icicles definitions are
;;  restored.
 
;;(@* "Programming Multi-Completions")
;;
;;  Programming Multi-Completions
;;  -----------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;  Multi-completions are completion candidates that are composed of
;;  parts separated by `icicle-list-join-string' and terminated by
;;  `icicle-list-end-string'.  See (@> "Multi-Completions"), above,
;;  for information on how users interact with multi-completions.
;;
;;  You can define your own Icicles commands that use
;;  multi-completions.  You can bind `icicle-list-join-string' or
;;  `icicle-list-end-string' to any strings you like, depending on
;;  your needs.  See (@> "Key Completion"), above, for an example
;;  where `icicle-list-join-string' is bound to " = " and
;;  `icicle-list-end-string' is "".  This section describes two
;;  additional variables that you can bind to affect the appearance
;;  and behavior of multi-completions.
;;
;;(@* "Variable icicle-list-use-nth-parts")
;;  ** Variable icicle-list-use-nth-parts **
;;
;;  Variable `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' affects the minibuffer
;;  behavior of multi-completions.  If you bind this to a list of
;;  whole numbers, then multi-completion candidates are transformed
;;  using those numbers as indexes.  During completion and cycling,
;;  whenever a sole candidate matches the user input, if that
;;  candidate is a multi-completion, then it is transformed by
;;  extracting and possibly reordering its parts according to
;;  `icicle-list-use-nth-parts'.
;;
;;  The actual candidate to match is still the original candidate; the
;;  transformation takes place after matching, for final insertion in
;;  the minibuffer.  This means that you must use this feature only
;;  with lax completion, since strict completion requires an exact
;;  match against the original completion candidate, and the
;;  transformed candidate will normally not match the original.
;;
;;  Variable `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' works as follows.  The
;;  matching candidate is split at each `icicle-list-join-string' into
;;  its component parts.  The indexes in `icicle-list-use-nth-parts'
;;  are then used to extract parts, in the same order as the indexes
;;  appear.  The extracted parts are joined back together in an order
;;  that you specify, separated by the value of user option
;;  `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string'.  An index greater than the
;;  number of parts means to use the last part.
;;
;;  For example: If the value of `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' is (1),
;;  then only the first part of the multi-completion is used as the
;;  completion candidate.  If the value is (2 1), then the resulting
;;  candidate is the second part followed by the first part, the two
;;  parts being joined by `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string'.  If the
;;  value is (1 99) and the multi-completion has fewer than 99 parts,
;;  then the first and last parts are used.  If the value is (2 1 2),
;;  then the resulting candidate is composed of the second part
;;  followed by the first part followed by the second part again.
;;
;;  Thus, you can use a given part any number of times.  You can also
;;  mix multi-completions and single-string completions, and you can
;;  mix multi-completions composed of different numbers of strings.
;;  For example, a set of completions might be:
;;
;;  ((("cmd1" "description of cmd1"))
;;   (("cmd2" "description of cmd" "more"))
;;   (("cmd3")))
;;
;;  If you use multi-completions with `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' in
;;  your own commands, please make sure that their doc strings let
;;  users know what to expect, and remind them of the behavior of
;;  option `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string'.  Let them know, in
;;  particular, that:
;;
;;  * They can match any part of a candidate as it is displayed in
;;    `*Completions*'.
;;
;;  * The candidate choice they make will in fact have the form that
;;    you define in your command.
;;
;;  * They can control how the parts are joined, using option
;;    `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string'.
;;
;;(@* "Variable icicle-candidate-properties-alist")
;;  ** Variable icicle-candidate-properties-alist **
;;
;;  Whereas variable `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string' affects the
;;  appearance of multi-completions in the minibuffer, variable
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' affects their appearance in
;;  buffer *Completions*.  You use it to apply text properties to
;;  individual parts of a multi-completion, where the parts are
;;  defined in the same way as for `icicle-list-use-nth-parts'.
;;
;;  This feature affects all candidates the same way.  See also
;;  (@> "Text Properties in *Completions") for how to apply text
;;  properties to individual candidates (which need not be
;;  multi-completions).
;;
;;  The value of `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' is an alist whose
;;  entries have either of these forms:
;;
;;  (NTH PROPERTIES) or (NTH PROPERTIES JOIN-TOO)
;;
;;  NTH is the number of the target multi-completion part.
;;
;;  PROPERTIES is a list of text properties to apply to the NTH part.
;;
;;  JOIN-TOO is optional.  If it is present and non-nil, then the text
;;  properties are also applied to the join string that follows the
;;  target part.
;;
;;  You can use any text properties, including `invisible', `keymap',
;;  `display', and properties that you define yourself and that have
;;  meaning to only your code.
;;
;;  As an example of its use, commands `icicle-fundoc',
;;  `icicle-vardoc', `icicle-doc', and `icicle-plist' bind
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' to
;;  ((1 (face 'icicle-special-candidate))), so that the first part of
;;  each multi-completion candidate is highlighted using face
;;  `icicle-special-candidate'.
;;
;;  Here is another example value of
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist':
;;
;;  ((3 (face 'underline))
;;   (2 (invisible t) t))
;;
;;  The first entry underlines the third multi-completion part.  The
;;  second entry makes both the second part and the join string that
;;  follows it invisible.
;;
;;  One use of making a completion part invisible is so that you can
;;  sort candidates using it, and let users match input against it,
;;  but not have it appear explicitly.
;;
;;  Recall that `completing-read' displays only the car of each
;;  element present in its TABLE (alist) argument.  For example, if
;;  you pass `completing-read' an alist such as (("foo" . 2) ("bar"
;;  . 3)), then only `foo' and `bar' are displayed as candidates.
;;  However, the PREDICATE argument to `completing-read' applies to
;;  the entire alist element, and your command that calls
;;  `completing-read' might well use the chosen candidate (e.g. `foo')
;;  to look up the entire element (e.g. ("foo" . 2)) for further
;;  processing.  Several Icicles commands, including `icicle-search'
;;  and `icicle-select-region', do that.
;;
;;  However, sometimes you might want the user to be able to match
;;  against the additional information (e.g. 2 and 3), and you might
;;  want to use it to sort candidates.  In that case, you can use the
;;  alist (("foo 2") ("bar 3")).  In cases where the additional
;;  information can be distracting, you can use multi-completion with
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' to hide it: Pass the alist
;;  ((("foo "2")) (("bar" 3"))) and use ((2 (invisible t))) for
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist'.
;;
;;  Keep in mind that hiding completion parts can be confusing to
;;  users.  Do so with care, and let your users know what to expect.
;;  Inform them that there are invisible parts that are nevertheless
;;  taken into account for input matching and candidate sorting.  When
;;  you hide parts, you will often want to omit them from the
;;  minibuffer as well, using `icicle-list-use-nth-parts', to avoid
;;  confusion.
;;
;;  Consider also the position of a hidden part: In some cases you
;;  might want to place it first among the multi-completion parts, but
;;  in many cases you will want to place it last, to minimize
;;  interference with prefix-completion matching.
;;
;;  Similar considerations apply to other text properties, such as
;;  `display' and `keymap', that change the appearance or behavior of
;;  a completion candidate.
;;
;;(@* "What You See Is Not What You Get")
;;  ** What You See Is Not What You Get **
;;
;;  While on the subject of confusing users, let me point out a
;;  general drawback that is common to both
;;  `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' and
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist': *not* WYSIWYG.  Keep this in
;;  mind if you decide to take advantage of these variables.  Users
;;  see one thing, choose it, and they get something different as a
;;  result.  That promotes confusion that you will need to weigh
;;  against the possible benefits.
;;
;;  Users are confused, because what they choose is not exactly what
;;  they get.  What's more, a user's completion choice is not
;;  reflected in the input history, leading to further confusion.  For
;;  example, Icicles highlighting of previously used inputs in buffer
;;  *Completions* does not apply to such a candidate, even though it
;;  was previously entered using `RET'.  It is the transformed
;;  candidate that was entered, not the candidate as it was proposed
;;  for choosing, so when that candidate is proposed again, it is not
;;  recognized as having been previously chosen.
;;
;;  The bottom line here is this: variables
;;  `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' and
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' are useful in certain
;;  contexts, but be aware of the downside: confusing your users.

;;  Text Properties in *Completions*
;;  --------------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;  Section (@> "Programming Multi-Completions") explains how to apply
;;  text properties to all multi-completion candidates in buffer
;;  *Completions* at the same time.  This section tells you how to
;;  apply text properties to individual candidates in *Completions*.
;;  The candidates need not be multi-completions.
;;
;;  There are two ways to do this:
;;
;;  1. Use the text properties as the value of the candidate's
;;     `icicle-special-candidate property.
;;
;;  2. Apply the text properties to the candidate.
;;
;;(@* "Using Property icicle-special-candidate")
;;  ** Using Property icicle-special-candidate **
;;
;;  In this approach, you attach the text properties as the value of
;;  property `icicle-special-candidate' to the symbol that represents
;;  the candidate.  If the candidate is a string, not a symbol, then
;;  `intern' it and use the resulting symbol.
;;
;;  If you want the effect to be temporary, then don't forget to set
;;  property `icicle-special-candidate' for the candidate to
;;  nil when you are done.
;;
;;  As a shortcut, if you use the value t instead of a property list
;;  for property `icicle-special-candidate', then face
;;  `icicle-special-candidate' will be used as the `face' property of
;;  the candidate.  In other words, using t is equivalent to using
;;  (face icicle-special-candidate).  This approach is used, for
;;  instance, in the definition of command `icicle-complete-keys'
;;  (`S-TAB').
;;
;;  As another shortcut, if you want several candidates to have face
;;  `icicle-special-candidate, instead of giving each of their symbols
;;  this property you can simply define (e.g. bind)
;;  `icicle-special-candidate-regexp' to match those candidates.
;;  (This works, whether the candidates are strings or symbols.)
;;
;;(@* "Applying Text Properties to a Candidate String")
;;  ** Applying Text Properties to a Candidate String **
;;
;;  In this approach, you apply the text properties to the string(s)
;;  that represent the candidate, which you then pass to
;;  `completing-read' in its TABLE (alist) parameter.  You can use
;;  multi-completions, if you want to, propertizing each the way you
;;  want.
;;
;;  You can use any text properties you like, including these:
;;
;;  * `face' - to make some completion candidates stand out in
;;    particular ways
;;
;;  * `help-echo' - for individualized candidate help
;;
;;  * `keymap' and `pointer' - for individualized mouse treatment of
;;    candidates
;;
;;  * `display' - to include images in candidates
;;
;;  * `invisible' - to hide part or all of particular candidates
;;    (which are nevertheless available for completion)
;;
;;  How does this work?  Icicles simply redefines the standard Emacs
;;  function `display-completion-list' so that it retains text
;;  properties.  Emacs should do the same, but it doesn't (yet).
;;
;;  Icicles command `icicle-read-color' presents a simple
;;  illustration.  In this case, a multi-completion is used, composed
;;  of an unpropertized string that names a color and a propertized
;;  string that names its RGB (red, green, blue) value.  The RGB
;;  string has a background of the same color - each completion
;;  candidate is thus accompanied by its own color swatch.
;;
;;  The code that does this is in function
;;  `icicle-make-color-candidate', which is used by
;;  `icicle-read-color':
;;
;;   (defun icicle-make-color-candidate (color-name)
;;     "Return candidate of COLOR-NAME and its hex RGB string.
;;   The hex RGB string has the color as background text property."
;;     (let ((rgb-string (hexrgb-color-name-to-hex color-name)))
;;       (put-text-property
;;         0 (length rgb-string) 'face
;;         (cons 'background-color rgb-string) rgb-string)
;;       (list (list color-name rgb-string))))
;;
;;  Users can match any part of the multi-completion: color name or
;;  RGB value.  Command `icicle-read-color' defines a set of sort
;;  orders that are pertinent to the color candidates.  Users can use
;;  `C-,' to sort by color name, RGB value, hue, saturation, value, or
;;  amount of red, blue, or green.
;;
;;  Icicles treats reading face names similarly, by redefining
;;  standard function `read-face-name' when you are in Icicle mode.
;;  In this case, multi-completions are not used.  The pertinent
;;  function is this, which just applies each face to its face-name
;;  candidate:
;;
;;   (defun icicle-make-face-candidate (face)
;;     "Return the name of FACE as a string propertized with FACE."
;;     (let ((face-name (copy-sequence (symbol-name face))))
;;       (put-text-property 0 (length face-name) 'face face face-name)
;;       (list face-name)))
;;
;;  See Also: (@> "Sorting Candidates and Removing Duplicates") for
;;  information about changing sort orders.

;;  Defining Icicles Commands (Including Multi-Commands)
;;  ----------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;(@* "Nothing To It!")
;;  ** Nothing To It! **
;;
;;  Defining a command that uses Icicles completion and cycling is
;;  simple: just call `completing-read' or `read-file-name' to read
;;  input, then act on that input.
;;
;;  Nothing could be simpler - just use `completing-read'or
;;  `read-file-name'!  Icicles does the rest.  This is the most
;;  important thing to learn about defining Icicles commands: you
;;  don't need to do anything except call `completing-read' or
;;  `read-file-name' as you would normally anyway.
;;
;;  Or at least as I HOPE you would normally.  I fear that many
;;  Emacs-Lisp programmers don't take sufficient advantage of
;;  `completing-read' when they could, using instead a function such
;;  as (quel horreur !)  `read-string' to read user input.
;;
;;(@* "Multi-Commands Are Easy To Define Too")
;;  ** Multi-Commands Are Easy To Define Too **
;;
;;  If defining an Icicles command is trivial, so is defining an
;;  Icicles multi-command.  For the same effort it takes to define a
;;  command that acts on a single input choice, you can have a command
;;  that acts on any number of input choices.  A multi-command takes
;;  advantage of an action function when cycling candidates, as
;;  described in "Multi-Commands" and "Choose All Completion
;;  Candidates", above.
;;
;;  In fact, there is no reason NOT to define your commands as
;;  multi-commands - you lose nothing, and you gain a lot.  Whenever
;;  it is appropriate for a user to possibly want to act on multiple
;;  objects, define a multi-command that does that.
;;
;;  Macros `icicle-define-command' and `icicle-define-file-command'
;;  make it easy to define a multi-command.  Without them, it is not
;;  so easy - see (@> "Defining Multi-Commands the Hard Way"), below,
;;  for a taste of what is involved.  If you read that section first,
;;  make sure you come back here to see how easy things can be.
;;
;;  Here is how you might define a multi-command to delete one or more
;;  files or directories:
;;
;;  1. Define the multi-command, `my-delete-file':
;;
;;  (icicle-define-file-command
;;   my-delete-file                  ; Command name
;;   "Delete a file or directory."   ; Doc string
;;   my-delete-file-or-directory     ; Function to perform the action
;;   "Delete file or directory: "    ; `read-file-name' arguments...
;;   default-directory nil t)
;;
;;  2. Define the action function that deletes a single file:
;;
;;  (defun my-delete-file-or-directory (file)
;;    "Delete file (or directory) FILE."
;;    (condition-case i-delete-file
;;        (if (eq t (car (file-attributes file)))
;;            (delete-directory file)
;;          (delete-file file))
;;      (error (message (error-message-string i-delete-file))
;;             (error (error-message-string i-delete-file)))))
;;
;;  There are two parts to the definition of `my-delete-file':
;;
;;  1. The definition of the command itself, using
;;     `icicle-define-file-command'.
;;
;;  2. The definition of a helper, action function,
;;     `my-delete-file-or-directory', which deletes a single file (or
;;     directory), given its name.
;;
;;  It is #1 that is of interest here, because that is essentially
;;  what you do to define any multi-command.
;;
;;  The details of #2 are less interesting, even if more complex in
;;  this case: `my-delete-file-or-directory' checks whether its
;;  argument is a file or directory, and then tries to delete it.  If
;;  an error occurs, it prints the error message and then returns the
;;  message, so that the calling command can report on all deletion
;;  errors.
;;
;;  In #1, the arguments to `icicle-define-file-command' are
;;  straightforward:
;;
;;  * The name of the command being defined `my-delete-file'.
;;
;;  * Its doc string.
;;
;;  * The function that actually performs the action on the input file
;;    name - `my-delete-file-or-directory'.
;;
;;  * The arguments that you would supply anyway to `read-file-name'
;;    to read a single file name.
;;
;;  These are the SAME things you would need if you were defining a
;;  simple command to delete a SINGLE file or directory.  The only
;;  differences here are that you:
;;
;;  * Use `icicle-define-file-command' instead of `defun' with an
;;    `interactive' spec.
;;
;;  * Separate the action code into a separate function (here,
;;    `my-delete-file-or-directory') that acts on a single object
;;    (here, a file).
;;
;;  When you use `icicle-define-file-command', the action function is
;;  called on the result of `read-file-name', and it is also bound to
;;  `icicle-candidate-action-fn', so that it will be applied to the
;;  current candidate via `C-RET' (or `C-next' and so on).
;;
;;  Command `icicle-all-candidates-action' (`C-!' -- see
;   (@> "Choose All Completion Candidates"), above) reports in buffer
;;  *Help* on the objects that it did not act upon successfully.  For
;;  this reporting, the function bound to `icicle-candidate-action-fn'
;;  (e.g. `my-delete-file-or-directory', above) should return `nil'
;;  for "success" and non-`nil' (for example, an error message) for
;;  "failure", whatever "success" and "failure" might mean in the
;;  particular context of use.  This is not a requirement, except if
;;  you want to take advantage of such reporting.  For a command that
;;  deletes files, it is important to let the user know which
;;  deletions failed when s?he tries to delete all matching candidates
;;  at once.
;;
;;  If the command you want to define acts on objects other than
;;  files, then use `icicle-define-command' instead of
;;  `icicle-define-file-command' - the only difference is that you
;;  then supply the arguments for `completing-read' instead of those
;;  for `read-file-name'.
;;
;;  To let users know that a command is a multi-command, and how to
;;  use it as such, `icicle-define-command' and
;;  `icicle-define-file-command' add this explanation to the doc
;;  string you provide for the multi-command:
;;
;;  ---
;;  Read input, then call `<your action function name>' to act on it.
;;
;;  Input-candidate completion and cycling are available.  While
;;  cycling, these keys act on the current candidate:
;;
;;  `C-RET'  - Act on current completion candidate only
;;  `C-next' - Act, then move to next prefix-completion candidate
;;  `C-prior'- Act, then move to previous prefix-completion candidate
;;  `next'   - Act, then move to next apropos-completion candidate
;;  `prior'  - Act, then move to previous apropos-completion candidate
;;  `C-!'    - Act on *all* candidates, successively (careful!)
;;
;;  Use `RET' or `S-RET' to finally choose a candidate, or `C-g' to
;;  quit.  This is an Icicles command - see `icicle-mode'.
;;  ---
;;
;;  Notice that the doc string of your new multi-command references
;;  your action function (e.g. `my-delete-file-or-directory').  The
;;  doc string you provide for the multi-command can thus be a little
;;  more abstract, leaving any detailed explanation of the action to
;;  the doc string of your action function.
;;
;;  To provide more flexibility, `icicle-define-command' and
;;  `icicle-define-file-command' provide some predefined bindings and
;;  allow for additional arguments.
;;
;;  Here is a definition of a multi-command, `change-font', that reads
;;  a font name and changes the selected frame to use that font.
;;
;;  1  (icicle-define-command
;;  2   change-font "Change font of current frame."
;;  3   (lambda (font)
;;  4     (modify-frame-parameters orig-frame
;;  5                              (list (cons 'font font))))
;;  6   "Font: " (mapcar #'list (x-list-fonts "*"))
;;  7   nil t nil nil nil nil
;;  8   ((orig-frame (selected-frame))
;;  9    (orig-font (frame-parameter nil 'font)))
;;  10  nil
;;  11  (modify-frame-parameters orig-frame
;;  12                           (list (cons 'font orig-font)))
;;  13  nil)
;;
;;  The arguments to `icicle-define-command' here are as follows:
;;
;;  Command name    (line 2)
;;  Doc string      (line 2)
;;  Action function (lines 3-5)
;;  Args passed to `completing-read' (lines 6-7)

;;  Additional initialization code (line 10)
;;  "Undo" code to run in case of error or user quit (lines 11-12)
;;  Additional code to run at the end (line 13)

;;  The following bindings are predefined - you can refer to them in
;;  the command body:
;;
;;   `orig-buff'   is bound to (current-buffer)
;;   `orig-window' is bound to (selected-window)
;;
;;  Before running any "undo" code that you supply, the original
;;  buffer is restored, in case of error or user quit (`C-g').
;;
;;  Most of the arguments to `icicle-define-command' are optional.  In
;;  this case, optional arguments were provided to save (lines 8-9)
;;  and then restore (lines 11-12) the original font and frame.

;;  ** Are Users Dependent on Icicles To Use Multi-Commands? **
;;
;;  For users to be able to take advantage of the Icicles features
;;  that your multi-command provides, they must load Icicles.  You can
;;  do this for them, by adding (require 'icicles nil t) to your code.
;;  The last two arguments mean that no error will be raised if for
;;  some reason Icicles cannot be found or successfully loaded.
;;
;;  But that brings up another question: What happens to your
;;  multi-command if Icicles is not available for a user, or s?he
;;  doesn't want to load it? No problem - your multi-command then
;;  automatically turns into a normal, single-choice command -
;;  graceful degradation.
;;
;;  Similarly, users can always turn off `icicle-mode' at any time, to
;;  return to the standard Emacs behavior.
;;
;;  Users will, in any case, need to load Icicles at compile time, in
;;  order to byte-compile your library that calls macro
;;  `icicle-define-command' or `icicle-define-file-command' - either
;;  that, or you can duplicate the definition of the macro in your
;;  library.  To let users load Icicles at (only) compile time, add
;;  this to your library that defines multi-commands:
;;
;;  (eval-when-compile '(require icicles))

;;
;;  Defining Multiple-Choice Menus
;;  ------------------------------
;;
;;  Icicles multi-commands (see (@> "Multi-Commands"), above) can be
;;  used provide users with multiple-choice menus.  While the possible
;;  choices can be accessed by minibuffer completion or cycling, a
;;  user can also display them in buffer *Completions* using `TAB' or
;;  `S-TAB', and click them there to choose them.
;;
;;  That is, buffer *Completions* can act as a multiple-choice menu.
;;
;;  Simple use case: Suppose that you use special characters (Greek
;;  letters, math symbols, accented letters in another language...),
;;  but only occasionally - you don't want to take the trouble to
;;  learn a special input method for them or flip to a different soft
;;  keyboard.  One simple way to handle this is to create a menu of
;;  such special characters - Greek letters, for instance.  You only
;;  need to create the menu once, providing the necessary completions
;;  as, say, Unicode characters.  When you need to input such a
;;  character, just use your command that pops up buffer *Completions*
;;  with the available special characters.  Even if you don't know how
;;  to type them on your keyboard, you can cycle through them or use
;;  `mouse-2' to choose them.
;;
;;  Here's a simple example of defining a command that uses a
;;  multiple-choice menu.  (Other examples given above, such as
;;  `my-delete-file-or-directory' are also examples, but this one uses
;;  menu items that look more like menu items.)
;;
;;  (icicle-define-command my-menu-command
;;      "Display menu and act on choice(s)."
;;      my-menu-action
;;      "`TAB' for menu.  `C-mouse-2' to choose. "
;;      my-menu-items nil t)
;;
;;  (defvar my-menu-items 
;;    '(("Foobar" . foobar-fn) ("Toto" . toto-fn) ("Titi" . titi-fn))
;;    "Alist of menu items and their associated commands.")  
;;
;;  (defun my-menu-action (item)
;;    "Call function associated with menu-item ITEM."
;;    (funcall (cdr (assoc item my-menu-items))))
;;
;;  (defun foobar-fn () (message "Foobar chosen"))                    
;;  (defun toto-fn () (message "Toto chosen"))                     
;;  (defun titi-fn () (message "Titi chosen"))
;;
;;  A user does `M-x my-menu-command' and hits `TAB' to display this
;;  menu in the *Completions* buffer:
;;
;;  Click mouse-2 on a completion to select it.  (C-h: help)
;;
;;  Possible completions are:
;;  Foobar          Titi
;;  Toto
;;
;;  The user presses and holds the Control key.  S?he clicks `Foobar'
;;  - message "Foobar chosen" appears.  S?he clicks `Toto - message
;;  "Toto chosen" appears.
;;
;;  And so on - all while holding Control pressed.  Any number of menu
;;  items can be chosen, any number of times.  The command is finally
;;  exited with `RET' or `C-g'.
;;
;;  The `TABLE' argument passed to `completing-read' here is
;;  `my-menu-items', an alist of key-value pairs, where the key is a
;;  menu-item name and the value is the function that implements the
;;  menu item.  For example, menu item `Foobar' is implemented by
;;  function `foobar-fn', and the alist element is therefore ("Foobar"
;;  . foobar-fn).
;;
;;  Function `my-menu-action' is executed when a user clicks
;;  `C-mouse-2' on a menu item.  It just looks up the menu item's
;;  function in alist `my-menu-items', and then calls that function.
;;
;;  What?  You think it's odd that the user must hit `TAB' to display
;;  the menu?  Then just use this code instead:
;;
;;  (icicle-define-command
;;   my-menu-command
;;   "Display menu and act on choice(s)."
;;   my-menu-action
;;   "`C-mouse-2' or `C-RET' to choose menu items"
;;   my-menu-items nil t nil nil nil nil
;;   ((icicle-show-*Completions*-initially-flag t)))
;;
;;  This just adds a binding for
;;  `icicle-show-*Completions*-initially-flag', so that *Completions*
;;  is displayed initially.
;;
;;  Granted, the *Completions* display doesn't exactly look like your
;;  average menu.  And the header line doesn't mention the
;;  multiple-choice possibility (holding Control while clicking).  But
;;  the header does say to use `C-h' for help, and that help does
;;  mention `C-mouse-2' (as does the prompt).  And the menu does act
;;  like a menu.  And the doc string of `my-menu-command' can provide
;;  more help, as needed.
;;
;;  There are also some freebie advantages of using such menus,
;;  besides the feature of multiple-choice.  These include choosing
;;  menu items from the keyboard, with completion, and cycling among
;;  menu items.  The additional features are all explained when the
;;  user hits `C-h'.

;;  ----------------------------
;;

;;  illustration of using macro `icicle-define-command'.
;;
;;(@* "How Multi `M-x' is Defined")
;;  ** How Multi `M-x' is Defined **
;;
;;  The definition of `icicle-execute-extended-command' provides an
;;  interesting illustration of using `icicle-define-command'.  The
;;  candidate action function itself binds a candidate action
;;  function, in case the candidate is a command that reads input with
;;  completion.
;;
;;  (icicle-define-command 
;;    icicle-execute-extended-command   ; `M-x' in Icicle mode.
;;    "Read command name, then read its arguments and call it.
;;    icicle-execute-extended-command-1 ; Action function
;;    (format "Execute command%s: "     ; `completing-read' args
;;            (if current-prefix-arg
;;                (format " (prefix %d)"
;;                        (prefix-numeric-value current-prefix-arg))
;;               ""))
;;    obarray 'commandp t nil 'extended-command-history nil nil
;;    ((last-cmd last-command)))        ; Save the last command.
;;
;;  (defun icicle-execute-extended-command-1 (cmd-name)
;;    "Action function for `icicle-execute-extended-command'."
;;     (set-buffer orig-buff) ; bound by `icicle-define-command'.
;;     (select-window orig-window)
;;     (let ((icicle-candidate-action-fn
;;            (lambda (x) (funcall (intern cmd-name) x))))
;;       (call-interactively (intern cmd-name) 'record-it)))
;;
;;  The last three lines of this action function rebind
;;  `icicle-candidate-action-fn' to a function that calls the
;;  candidate `cmd-name' on a single argument that it reads.  This is
;;  only used if `cmd-name' is a command that, itself, reads an input
;;  argument with completion.  When that is the case, you can use
;;  completion on that input, and if you do that, you can use `C-RET'
;;  to use command `cmd-name' as a multi-command.  In other words,
;;  this binding allows for two levels of multi-commands.
;;
;;  There's one thing wrong with this definition, however.  In the
;;  action function, the candidate command is applied to a candidate
;;  that is a string.  What if it is a command, such as
;;  `describe-variable', that expects a symbol argument?  Or a number
;;  argument?  There is no way to know what kind of command will be
;;  used, and what kind of argument it will need.  The solution is to
;;  first try a string candidate argument, then convert the string to
;;  a symbol or number.  That is, bind this to
;;  `icicle-candidate-action-fn':
;;
;;  (lambda (x) 
;;    (condition-case nil
;;        (funcall cmd x)    ; Try to use a string candidate.  If that
;;      (wrong-type-argument ; didn't work, use a symbol or number.
;;       (funcall cmd (car (read-from-string x))))))
;;
;;  Ah, but there's still a problem with this definition.  What if the
;;  command `cmd' does something that changes the focus away from the
;;  minibuffer's frame?  That's the case for `describe-variable', for
;;  instance: it selects buffer `*Help*'.  To fix this potential
;;  problem, the action function needs to reset the focus back to the
;;  minibuffer frame:
;;
;;  (lambda (x) 
;;    (condition-case nil
;;        (funcall cmd x)
;;      (wrong-type-argument
;;       (funcall cmd (car (read-from-string x)))))
;;    (select-frame-set-input-focus

;;  
;;  Defining Multi-Commands the Hard Way
;;  ------------------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.  It gives you a taste
;;  of what is involved behind the scene when you effortlessly use
;;  `icicle-define-command' or `icicle-define-file-command' to define
;;  a multi-command.
;;  See (@> "Defining Icicles Commands (Including Multi-Commands)"),
;;  above.
;;
;;  It can be good to know this, if only for the rare case where you
;;  need to define a multi-command that has special behavior not
;;  provided by `icicle-define(-file)-command' out of the box.  For
;;  example, if you want the normal, single-choice `RET' behavior to
;;  be different from the multiple-choice `C-RET' behavior, then you
;;  might want to roll your own.
;;
;;  To write your own multi-command, you must make the command do
;;  this:
;;
;;  1. Call `completing-read' or `read-file-name', and perform some
;;     action on the completed input.
;;
;;  2. Bind `icicle-candidate-action-fn' to a function that performs
;;     an action on a completion candidate - possibly the same action
;;     as #1.
;;
;;  #1 just lets people use the command normally, to perform the #1
;;  action on a completion candidate entered with `RET'.  Because of
;;  #2, people can perform the #2 action on any completion candidates,
;;  while still continuing to cycle or complete candidates.
;;  Typically, the actions for #1 and #2 are the same, but nothing
;;  prevents you from using different actions.
;;
;;  When internal variable `icicle-candidate-action-fn' is not bound,
;;  the default action is performed: display help on the current
;;  completion candidate.
;;
;;  Here is a definition of a simple (not multi-) command that reads a
;;  font name and then changes the selected frame to use that font.
;;  By virtue of calling `completing-read', Icicles completion and
;;  cycling are available, using all available font names as the pool
;;  of candidates.
;;
;;  (defun change-font ()
;;    "Change font of selected frame."
;;    (modify-frame-parameters
;;     (selected-frame)
;;     (list (cons 'font (completing-read

;;                        nil t)))))
;;
;;  Here's a definition of a multi-command `change-font' that takes
;;  advantage of an action function when cycling candidates:
;;
;;  1  (defun change-font ()
;;  2    "Change font of current frame."
;;  3    (interactive)
;;  4   (let* ((orig-frame (selected-frame))

;;  6          (icicle-candidate-action-fn
;;  7           ;; Perform the action on a candidate, without leaving
;;  8           ;; `completing-read'.  You can do this over and over.
;;  9           (lambda (font)
;;  10             (modify-frame-parameters orig-frame
;;  11                                      (list (cons 'font font))))))
;;  12     (condition-case nil
;;  13         (modify-frame-parameters
;;  14          orig-frame
;;  15          (list
;;  16           (cons 'font
;;  17                 ;; Perform the action on your final choice.
;;  18                 (completing-read
;;  19                  "Font: "
;;  20                  (mapcar #'list (x-list-fonts "*")) nil t))))
;;  21       ((quit error)
;;  22        (modify-frame-parameters
;;  23         orig-frame
;;  24         (list (cons 'font orig-font)))))))
;;
;;  As you can see, there is a lot more going on here than in the
;;  simple-command version.  These are the points to keep in mind,
;;  when defining a multi-command by hand:
;;
;;  1. Save anything you need to restore, so you can, in effect, undo
;;     the action in case of `C-g' (lines 4-5).
;;
;;  2. Bind `icicle-candidate-action-fn' to the action to perform
;;     (lines 6-11).
;;
;;  3. Perform the action, using `completing-read' to provide the
;;     target candidate (lines 13-20).  Do this in the body of a
;;     `condition-case' (lines 12-24).
;;
;;  4. Restore the original context in the error-handling part of the
;;     `condition-case' (lines 22-24).  Include `quit' in the
;;     error-type list.
;;
;;  The above definition is not quite complete, in fact.  To let
;;  `icicle-all-candidates' be able to report on failures, the
;;  `icicle-candidate-action-fn' code should also trap errors and
;;  return nil as an error indicator.
;;
;;  In fact, things can get even hairier (much hairier) still, if the
;;  function at the core of your command does things like create a new
;;  frame - especially on MS Windows, with its click-to-focus window
;;  manager.  The action of `change-font' doesn't do that, but if it
;;  did, you would need to redirect the focus back to the minibuffer
;;  frame, using `select-frame-set-input-focus'.  As an illustration
;;  of what's involved, here's a definition that would deal with such
;;  problems.  It also traps `icicle-candidate-action-fn' errors,
;;  returning nil to report success and the error message to report
;;  failure.
;;
;;  (defun change-font ()
;;    "Change font of current frame."

;;(@* "Global Filters")
;;
;;  Global Filters
;;  --------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;  Which completion candidates get displayed?  To review:
;;
;;  1. The domain of discourse, that is, all possible candidates, is
;;     determined by the arguments to `completing-read',
;;     `read-file-name', or `M-x'.
;;
;;  2. You type something in the minibuffer.  This narrows the
;;     possible candidates to those that match your input.  Matching
;;     can be prefix-matching or apropos-matching.
;;
;;  Wouldn't it sometimes be useful to filter #1 in a global way,
;;  before filtering it with your input (#2)?  Functions
;;  `completing-read' and `read-file-name' take a predicate argument,
;;  so that can be used for global filtering.  However, those
;;  functions are usually called from some command, and it would also
;;  be useful to give end users, not just programmers, some way to
;;  globally filter candidates.
;;
;;  For example, if you have a command, such as `icicle-buffer', that
;;  reads a buffer name and displays the buffer, some users might
;;  always be interested only in buffers that are associated with
;;  files.  They don't want to see possible candidates like
;;  `*scratch*' and `*Messages*'.  What they need is a way to apply a
;;  global predicate that limits candidates to file-buffer names - but
;;  they don't have access to the call to `completing-read' that is
;;  inside the command definition.
;;
;;  For this reason, some global filtering variables are provided by
;;  Icicles:
;;
;;    `icicle-must-match-regexp', `icicle-must-not-match-regexp',
;;    `icicle-must-pass-predicate', `icicle-extra-candidates'.
;;
;;  The first and second of these are regexps that candidates must
;;  match and must not match, respectively, in order for them to be
;;  displayed.  The third is a predicate that candidates must satisfy.
;;  The fourth is a list of extra candidates to display.  Any of the
;;  filters can be nil, in which case it has no effect.
;;
;;  Variable `icicle-extra-candidates' is not really a "filter".  It
;;  does not restrict the set of possible candidates - rather, it
;;  extends that set.
;;
;;  These global variables are internal variables - they are not meant
;;  to be customized.  If you are not an Emacs-Lisp programmer, you
;;  will not use these variables, but some commands that you use might
;;  provide corresponding global-filter user options.  Icicles
;;  provides customizable user options for command `icicle-buffer',
;;  for example:
;;
;;    `icicle-buffer-match-regexp'    - Regexp that buffers must match
;;    `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp' - Regexp buffers must not match
;;    `icicle-buffer-predicate'       - Predicate buffer must satisfy
;;    `icicle-buffer-extras'          - Extra buffers to display
;;
;;  You might, for instance, customize `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp'
;;  to not display file-buffers whose names end in `.elc', and
;;  customize `icicle-buffer-predicate' to show only buffers that are
;;  associated with files.  The former would use a value of "\\.elc$",
;;  and the latter would use a value such as this:
;;
;;     (lambda (bufname) (buffer-file-name (get-buffer bufname)))."
;;
;;  If you, as a programmer, write a command, and you want to expose
;;  global filters to users of the command, you should:
;;
;;  1. Create corresponding user options that can be customized.
;;  2. Bind the user options to the corresponding filtering variables.
;;
;;  If you use `icicle-define-command' or `icicle-define-file-command'
;;  to define a command (recommended), then you can simply pass the
;;  filter-variable bindings as part of the BINDINGS argument.
;;
;;  For example, here is the core definition of `icicle-buffer':
;;
;;   (icicle-define-command
;;    icicle-buffer                          ; Command name
;;    "Switch to a different buffer."        ; Doc string
;;    switch-to-buffer                       ; Action function
;;    "Switch to buffer: "                   ; completing-read args
;;    (mapcar (lambda (buf) (list (buffer-name buf)))
;;            (buffer-list))
;;    nil nil (buffer-name (if (fboundp 'another-buffer)
;;                             (another-buffer nil t)
;;                           (other-buffer (current-buffer))))
;;    nil nil nil
;;    ;; Filter bindings
;;    ((icicle-must-match-regexp icicle-buffer-match-regexp)
;;     (icicle-must-not-match-regexp icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp)
;;     (icicle-must-pass-predicate icicle-buffer-predicate)
;;     (icicle-extra-candidates icicle-buffer-extras)
;;     (icicle-sort-function icicle-buffer-sort)))
;;
;;  If you define a command that uses completion, but you don't use
;;  `icicle-define-command' or `icicle-define-file-command', then you
;;  can just bind such variables around a call to `completing-read' or
;;  `read-file-name'.  Command `icicle-complete-keys' presents an
;;  example of this, binding `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp'.

;;     in the user's `load-path' (there is no load error).  If Icicles
;;     is present, however, then users can take advantage of each use
;;     you make of `completing-read' and `read-file-name' in your
;;     code.
;;
;;  2. Use an input-completion read function, such as
;;     `completing-read' or `read-file-name', when you read input!
;;     There is almost never a reason not to use an input-completion
;;     function when reading user input - especially considering that
;;     you need not always provide a REQUIRE-MATCH argument.
;;
;;     Try also to find an appropriate PREDICATE argument, and a good
;;     set of default values to pass to `completing-read' as its TABLE
;;     argument.  Too often, I think, we use an overly general TABLE
;;     argument, such as the `obarray', and we don't provide a (good)
;;     PREDICATE.  Using an input-completion function with an
;;     appropriate candidate completion list and predicate can help
;;     users considerably.  I'm as guilty of TABLE and PREDICATE
;;     laziness as anyone, by the way.
;;
;;  3. Avoid using a literal-string `interactive' spec (e.g.
;;     (interactive "fFile: ")) that reads input with completion.
;;     Instead, call `completing-read' or `read-file-name' within the
;;     `interactive' spec.  This saves Icicles users of progressive
;;     completion the need to hit `RET' multiple times to pass their
;;     input up through multiple levels of recursive minibuffers to
;;     the top level.  See (@> "Progressive Completion"), above.
;;
;;  4. In many cases, it makes sense to define a multi-command, rather
;;     than a simple command.  People can always use a multi-command
;;     as a simple command, but not vice versa.
;;     See (@> "Multi-Commands"),
;;     (@> "Defining Icicles Commands (Including Multi-Commands)"),
;;     and (@> "Defining Multi-Commands the Hard Way"), above.
;;
;;  5. You can bind `icicle-sort-function' temporarily to any sort
;;     function you need.
;;
;;  6. Function `icicle-next-candidate' is a general framework for
;;     letting users cycle completions of partial input strings.  I
;;     use it to define the cycling behavior for both prefix and
;;     apropos completions.  You can use it to easily define other,
;;     application-specific input matching/completion/cycling
;;     behavior.  Just supply it with a function that takes the
;;     current partial user input (a string) and returns a list of
;;     candidate completions, however those might be defined.
;;
;;  7. If the potential number of completion candidates is enormous,
;;     then icompletion display in *Completions* can be slow.  In that
;;     case, consider turning it off for the duration of the command,
;;     by binding `icicle-incremental-completion-flag' to nil.  An
;;     alternative to turning it off is the approach taken in Icicles
;;     (e.g. `icicle-vardoc' and `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry'):
;;     Just add a reminder to the doc string to tell users that they
;;     can toggle `icicle-incremental-completion-flag' with `C-#'.
;;
;;  8. Another of my libraries that can help programmers provide
;;     default values is `thingatpt+.el'.  It provides functions for
;;     picking up symbols, sexps, numbers, words, and other sorts of
;;     thing near the text cursor (`point').

;;  La Petite Histoire
;;  ------------------
;;
;;  1. This library started life as `elect-mbuf.el', by Hans Koomen.
;;
;;    Original posting:
;;    From koomen@cs.rochester.edu Mon Jun 19 19:27:58 1989
;;    To: info-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu
;;    Cc: Hans <Koomen@cs.rochester.edu>
;;    Subject: elect-mbuf.el
;;    Date: Tue, 13 Jun 89 15:17:07 -0400
;;
;;  2. I hacked and enhanced the library in various relatively minor
;;  ways over the years, maintaining it as `elect-mbuf.el' - see
;;  details under (@> "Change log"), below.
;;
;;  I did not change the main functionality of the library during this
;;  period: it always cycled the COMPLETE list of (prefix) completion
;;  candidates passed to `completing-read'; it did not update the
;;  candidate list based on the current minibuffer contents.
;;
;;  So, for instance, if you had `M-x for' in the minibuffer, `C-n'
;;  would cycle among ALL Emacs commands, not just those that start
;;  with "for".  I used the library this way for fifteen years without
;;  thinking much about this behavior or the code behind it.
;;
;;  3. In July 2005, Lennart Borgman gave `elect-mbuf.el' a quick try,
;;  and intuitively expected to see behavior along the lines that you
;;  see now for prefix completion:
;;
;;  a. `C-n' should cycle completions relative to the current input,
;;     not all completions supplied to `completing-read'.
;;  b. If buffer *Completions* is displayed, `C-n' should highlight
;;     the current candidate there.
;;
;;  Good idea Lennart (<lennart.borgman.073@student.lu.se>).  So I
;;  implemented that behavior, and renamed the library "Icicles" (for,
;;  I suppose, "input cycles" or some such - or because it's "cool").
;;
;;  4. The code changes I made to implement #3 (completion cycling
;;  relative to current input) made me realize that other completion
;;  matchings could be implemented in a similar way.  Prefix
;;  completion (the completion provided by Emacs) is handy, but it is
;;  also sometimes a bit limited.  The idea of apropos completion
;;  occurred to me, and I implemented that as well.
;;
;;  5. I extended the library quite a bit more, in terms of
;;  convenience (highlighting, treatment of buffer *Completions*,...,
;;  but also in terms of functionality.  In particular, it now treats
;;  file names too.  And, because Emacs 21 and later versions use
;;  `read-file-name' for `find-file' and so on, Icicles now treats
;;  `read-file-name' the same as `completing-read'.
;;
;;  6. On another suggestion from LennartBorgman, I made Icicles take
;;  advantage of Delete Selection mode.  And I finally implemented it
;;  as a minor mode.
;;
;;  7, 8, 9,...  One thing has led to another, and I've just kept
;;  adding features.  Feature creep, I guess.  But the more I play
;;  with Icicles, the more I imagine new ways it might be made more
;;  useful.
 
;;(@* "Note on Non-Nil `pop-up-frames' on MS Windows")
;;
;;  Note on Non-Nil `pop-up-frames' on MS Windows
;;  ---------------------------------------------
;;
;;  If you use `pop-up-frames' = t, like I do, you might have noticed
;;  that Emacs completion does not play well with using separate
;;  frames for each buffer.  In particular, it does not play well with
;;  having a separate frame for buffer *Completions*.  When you try to
;;  complete input using `TAB', a new frame is created for buffer
;;  *Completions*, and, at least on MS Windows, it is selected, taking
;;  the input focus away from the original frame's minibuffer!
;;
;;  This means that, once the *Completions* buffer has been displayed
;;  in a separate frame, you cannot, for instance, cycle completion
;;  candidates, without first reselecting the original frame manually.
;;  You cannot even use normal completion - you cannot add text in the
;;  minibuffer, or delete text there, because the minibuffer in the
;;  original frame no longer has the input focus.  Bummer.
;;
;;  In general, Emacs does not play too well with one-buffer-per-frame
;;  (`pop-up-frames' = t), and this is a good example of that general
;;  problem.
;;
;;  I reported this Emacs bug.  I'm hoping it will be corrected in
;;  Emacs 22.x.
;;
;;  I don't have this problem of loss of frame input focus in my own
;;  setup, even though I use `pop-up-frames' = t, because I use my
;;  library `oneonone.el'.  (Try it!)  If you need a solution while
;;  waiting for Emacs 22, you can try doing something similar to what
;;  I do in `oneonone.el':
;;
;;  1. Use dedicated frames for both *Completions* and the minibuffer.
;;
;;  2. Display buffer *Completions* using a special-display function
;;  that explicitly redirects the input focus from the *Completions*
;;  frame back to the minibuffer frame.

;;              1on1-flash-ding-minibuffer-frame.
;; 2005/05/10 dadams
;;     Hacked completing-read to remove *Completions* window at end
;;       if require-match is non-nil.  (Don't know why/when this
;;       became a problem.)
;; 2004/09/21 dadams
;;     Updated to work in Emacs 21 (and 20):
;;       next-default-input uses delete-minibuffer-contents for 21,
;;       but erase-buffer for 20.
;;       minibuffer-completion-help+:
;;         bind inhibit-read-only to t around erase-buffer.
;; 2001/01/10 dadams
;;     Protected remove-windows-on via fboundp.
;; 1999/09/03 dadams
;;     Added: mbuf-completion-help-face,
;;            mbuf-completion-help-title-face.
;;     minibuffer-completion-help+:
;;       Use mbuf-*-face's instead of hard-coding.
;;     minibuffer-completion-help-string,
;;     completing-read-prompt-suffix: defconst -> defvar.
;; 1999/08/26 dadams
;;     Protected faces via boundp.
;; 1999/04/13 dadams
;;     Bound delete-lines to M-S-DEL and M-S-backspace.
;; 1999/03/17 dadams
;;     protect calls with test fboundp.
;; 1996/04/26 dadams
;;     Put escaped newlines on long-line strings.
;; 1996/03/26 dadams
;;     minibuffer-completion-help+: concat -> concat-w-faces (color).
;; 1995/12/20 dadams
;;     exit-minibuffer: Iconify *Completion* frame.
;; 1995/12/15 dadams
;;     abort-minibuffer-input:
;;       Reset minibuffer-completion-table to avoid icompletion.
;;     Defined replacement exit-minibuffer to do the same as #1.
;; 1995/12/01 dadams
;;     abort-minibuffer-input: Incorporated delete-selection-mode code
;;     rebind-minibuffer-completion-maps: Added C-g bindings for
;;       minibuffer-local-map, minibuffer-local-ns-map,
;;       minibuffer-local-isearch-map.
;; 1995/10/25 dadams
;;     Put defvar of minibuffer-completion-help-string after do
;;       rebind-minibuffer-completion-maps, so its doc string gives
;;       bindings.
;; 1995/10/24 dadams
;;     Mention ESC-TAB completion in completing-read.
;; 1995/10/17 dadams
;;     Let minibuffer use ESC-TAB for completion (Lisp symbols etc.)
;;     completing-read:
;;       Minibuffer adopts current buffer's ESC-TAB binding.
;;     Added command-calling-for-completion to memorize current
;;       command (done in completion-setup-hook).
;; 1995/09/12 dadams
;;     Added abort-minibuffer-input.
;;     Define C-g as abort-minibuffer-input in
;;       completion-list-mode-map and minibuffer-local-* maps.
;;     No self-insertion for completion-list-mode-map.
;; 1995/08/16 dadams
;;     next-default-input: Fixed bug - skip repeated alist entries.
;; 1995/08/10 dadams
;;     Rewrote minibuffer-completion-help+:
;;       Provide help even if no completions.
;;     So, added minibuffer-completion-help-string.
;;     `?' defined correctly for minibuffer-local-must-match-map.
;; 1995/08/08 dadams
;;     next-default-input: error msg: no hard coding of key seq.
;; 1995/08/02 dadams
;;     Major rewrite.
;;       No reminders in prompts.  Added minibuffer-completion-help+
;;       to provide help info for *Completions*.
;;     Log for functions that were previously in simple+.el:
;;       choose-completion-string, completion-setup-function,
;;       switch-to-completions.
;; 2005/07/28 dadams
;;     completion-setup-function:
;;       Renamed icicle-completing-read-prompt-suffix to
;;         icicle-prompt-suffix.
;; 2005/07/15 dadams
;;     choose-completion-string, completion-setup-function:
;;       Updated for Emacs 21+.
;; 2005/07/10 dadams
;;     Renamed: command-calling-for-completion to
;;              icicle-cmd-calling-for-completion.
;; 2004/09/21 dadams
;;     Only redefine choose-completion-string if prior to Emacs 21.
;; 1999/03/17 dadams
;;     choose-completion-string:
;;       Added doc string.  Updated to correspond to Emacs 34.1.
;;     completion-setup-function: diff prompt setups.
;;       face1 & face2 tests.
;;     Added: switch-to-completions.
;; 1996/04/26 dadams
;;     Put escaped newlines on long-line strings.
